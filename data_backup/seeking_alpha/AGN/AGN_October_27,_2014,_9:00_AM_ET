David E. I. Pyott 
In Q3, Allergan posted the strongest increase in absolute dollar sales in any quarter in our 64-year history with strong contributions from nearly all of our businesses and major products. Overall sales increased year-over-year 17.6% in local currencies and by 17.2% in dollars. After topping the prior record reported in Q2 2014, this is an outstanding achievement and a attribute to the ongoing focus of our employees around the world.
Over the summer, we used a leading third-party specialist to field a previously planned global engagement survey with our employees. The results showed a great increase in scores versus the same survey conducted in 2012 and placed Allergan high on many metrics and close to the ratings for global best employer. 
Returning to the strength and momentum in the business, we\xe2\x80\x99re benefitting from strong global markets in which we operate from many product launches post regulatory approvals in the US and internationally and strong returns from strategic investments to build and grow new products and new categories. 
In terms of earnings, the acceleration is even more notable than the growth in sales. In Q3, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share at $1.78 jumped 44.7% versus Q3 of 2013. EPS exceeded the top end of the outlook provided on the last earnings call by $0.31 driven by sales exceeding the top end of the outlook by approximately $40 million accompanied by disciplined spending. The benefits from the announced restructuring program are marginal in the third quarter. 
As we\xe2\x80\x99ve now announced, all employee reductions accepting some minor programs still subject to review by Works Councils in a few European countries. We\xe2\x80\x99re not ready to move onto our goal of creating an even stronger and more nimble company. The earnings impact from the cost reductions will be significant in Q4 and continuing into 2015. Jim Hindman will comment on the further upward revision to our outlook for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the full year 2015 now in a range of $6.27 to $6.30 representing an increase of 31% to 32% over 2013. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP numbers to US GAAP, kindly consult our press release. 
As we drove an exceptionally strong growth in earnings in Q3, we continued to invest on a focused basis in our greatest long term growth opportunities. On a non-GAAP basis in Q3, we increased our SG&A investment by 6% versus Q3 of 2013 within which direct-to-consumer advertising investment increased by over 15%. DTC was directed to RESTASIS, BOTOX for chronic migraine, a new campaign for BOTOX for overactive bladder commenced in late July, and JUVEDERM and VOLUMA. Year-to-date, our DTC spend has reached almost $200 million, an increase of approximately 38% over the same period in 2013. 
Regarding R&D, investments in Q3 on a non-GAAP basis increased by 6.5%. For the full year 2014, R&D investment will exceed $1.1 billion even after we make adjustments as part of our restructuring program. Clearly, we remain committed to the long term health and strength of our R&D pipeline.
We\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by the progress of our pipeline. In September, we received approval for OZURDEX for diabetic macular edema in Europe and are now receiving individual country licenses. In the US, the FDA removed the limitations for the DME label which had previously restricted use to aphakic patients or phakic patients scheduled for cataract surgery. As we believe that up to 40% of DME patients are not fully responsive to anti-VEGF therapy, this represents one of the most significant opportunities in our eye care portfolio. Abicipar, our anti-VEGF DARPin remains on schedule to start Phase III trials in Q2 2015. 
Regarding our dry eye pipeline, our Phase II study for RESTASIS X is progressing well. We have one NCE for dry eye that entered the clinic earlier this year and expect to have a second dry eye NCE in the clinic in 2015. We\xe2\x80\x99ll also have Phase II date in early 2015 for Androgen for ocular surface disease. Furthermore, our Phase II studies for BOTOX for osteoarthritis and BOTOX for depression are recruiting patients.
Regarding the individual businesses, I\xe2\x80\x99ll commence with ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. Q3 sales continued on their strong growth trend increasing 14.4% in local currencies and by 14.2% in dollars, marking an acceleration from the year-to-date growth of 13.4% in local currencies and 12.7% in dollars. RESTASIS is on track to exceed $1 billion in sales in 2014 and was again an outstanding contributor with local currency growth year-over-year of 14.4% in Q3 and 17.5% year-to-date. 
In the US, RESTASIS is enjoying double digit volume growth with continuing strong uptick by ophthalmologists and even stronger growth in optometry. Our glaucoma products grew in Q3 year-over-year by 11.1% in local currencies and in dollars as we gained market share worldwide with a new boost from the introduction of unit dose LUMIGAN and Ganfort products internationally. Regular Ganfort was launched in China in Q3. For in-market worldwide sales, IMS reported in Q2, LUMIGAN and Ganfort, the bimatoprost products, exceeding for the first time the sales of the travoprost family of Travatan and DuoTrav. 
In the US, we\xe2\x80\x99re managing to improve the trajectory of LUMIGAN prescriptions but are impacted by higher managed care rebates. In Q3, we were at least pleased to record positive net sales growth after many quarters of year-over-year declines. Internationally, LUMIGAN and Ganfort continued to grow double digits in Q3. For 2015 in the US, we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that we have already secured preferred status for LUMIGAN in almost all of the important managed care plans. 
Since receiving the expanded DME label for OZURDEX in the US, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a marked increase in the number of injecting retina specialists. In Europe, the DME indication has already been launched in Germany, Austria, and Scandinavia. We also received approval for OZURDEX in Peru and in Malaysia for uveitis. With the important DME approvals in hand in the US and Europe we will report OZURDEX sales on a quarterly basis beginning in 2015.
Year-to-date we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased with our success recording $117 million in sales with over 30% growth year-over-year. Our recent launches of OPTIVE Advanced products, marketed as OPTIVE Plus in Europe, as well as OPTIVE FUSION in Europe, drove double digit sales growth in Q3 in the US and Europe. OPTIVE Advanced was also launched in Brazil and Mexico in Q3. 
In the US we continued to rapidly expand our PRED FORTE and FML business lines, both as brands as well as generics enjoying strong volume increases in addition to taking price increases. Regarding the global ophthalmic market per the IMS Q2 Report, the last period for which data was period, IMS again showed Allergan as the fastest growing full line branded company. In a market growing a robust 11%, Allergan grew 15% with Novartis including Alcon at 6% and Valeant including Bausch & Lomb at 7%. In the US year-to-date August per IMS data, Allergan has gained more market share than any other company in the branded ophthalmic market. 
Turning to BOTOX, Q3 sales increased year-over-year by 16.0% in local currencies with double digit growth in both the therapeutic and aesthetic categories and by 15.3% in dollars, marking an acceleration in trend as year-to-date growth stands at 13.8% growth in local currencies and at 12.7% in dollars. In the US all our key indications including chronic migraine, the two bladder conditions and upper limb spasticity continued on their strong upswing driven by a broad suite of training, practice support, and reimbursement programs.
Furthermore, we increased patient awareness through our direct-to-consumer advertising with commercials for chronic migraine and since the end of July, for overactive bladder. At the end of September, [Marc\xe2\x80\x99s] increased the list price for Xeomin therapeutic as well as cosmetic. A price increased for Dysport was posted earlier in the year. 
In Europe, despite tenders and mandated price increases, we grew the therapeutic category in Q2 in the double digits, driven by the new indications for chronic migraine, bladder, and the most recently approved indication of lower limb spasticity. The latter indication was recently launched in Germany and Scandinavia. Since the last earnings call over active bladder was approved in Brazil, Venezuela, Singapore, Jordan, and Kuwait. The remark to Europe about Q2 should have been Q3 in double digits, just for clarification. 
Moving onto the Aesthetics side of the franchise, we estimate, based on survey data that the US market in Q3 grew around 10% with BOTOX sales growth being further boosted by the 3% price increase posted in January. BOTOX share in August 2015 remained high at over 77% with a point of share loss versus August 2013 with more share gain by Dysport than Xeomin. Since taking over Dysport, Galderma seems to be stabilizing the brand as they gave away free Dysport to support the restylane fillers. 
In Europe we enjoyed particularly strong sales in Western Europe in Q3 as we leveraged our crow\xe2\x80\x99s feet lines approval. Growth was also supported by continuing strong sales in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Given lack of market data, it is not clear if the strong growth was due to market share gains or just the benefits of a strong market. 
In facial aesthetics Q3 sales continued on a torrid pace with a growth of 52.5% in local currencies and 51.3% in dollars, with major contributions delivered from every operating region 
In almost all markets where the new Vycross collection of products have been launched, these products are incremental while sales of base JUVEDERM remain flat. This reflects the new products represent game changing market expanding technology. Worldwide, we estimate that the market in Q2, the last period for which market data is available, that the market grew 12% in value with Allergan driving all of the growth with some sales loss by the combined group of other players.
In the US we estimate the market in syringes grew mid-single digits in Q3 but grew substantially more in value due to the premium pricing of Allergan products. Based on our analytics earlier generation volumizing products such as Radiesse, Perlane and Sculptra have been most impacted by VOLUMA. In terms of market share, Allergan in Q3 had an estimated 45% of the market in unites, Galderma 32% and Merck 21% with Allergan gaining about nine market share points year-over-year, mostly at the expense of the restylane family of products.
After the major losses suffered under Valeant ownership, Galderma seems to have stabilized market share at the new lower base. In Europe, including Eastern Europe, syndicated data shows for Q2 a slow overall market growing at only 3.4%. However, all of the slowdown from the Q1 growth rate of over 20% is accounted for by Eastern Europe as Western Europe in both quarters grew 14% to 15% year-over-year. In Europe, Allergan in market grew in excess of 40% in Q2. VOLIFT was approved in Thailand and launched in Canada in September. 
Breast aesthetics sales in Q3 increased 6.3% in local currencies and by 6.1% in dollars. Sales of breast implants and tissue expanders were flat worldwide with the increase being accounted for by SERI Scaffold. Market conditions in the US for breast implants remained weak in a flat unit market. We were prepared to accept some unit share loss as we migrated our product mix to the higher priced 410 shaped gel implant and focused on the introduction of our SERI Scaffold product for tissue support in the hospital channel. In Europe, the market in Q2 based on syndicated data, grew 3% with Allergan gaining some marginal unit share year-over-year. The base breast implant business grew strongly in China, Japan, Canada, and Australia principally due to recent product introductions. 
Our skin care and other franchise grew to 11.2% in local currencies and 11.1% in dollars. Included in this line item is the SANCTURA XR product for urology which had close to zero sales in Q3 of 2014 versus $4 million in the prior year. This clearly impacted the overall growth rate. 
Commenting the skin care franchise, we recorded notable growth for several products namely ACZONE and TAZORAC in the US, both grew in excess of 20%. Given the renewed focus on TAZORAC and the genericization of many competitors retinoid products, we\xe2\x80\x99re proud that TAZORAC became the most prescribed single retinoid agent in Q3 in the US. ACZONE benefitting from DTC during 2014 continues to gain market share in the anti-inflammatory acne category.
Our skin medical line also grew double digits benefitting from the introduction of Lytera, our skin lightening product. As we reduce promotional support for LATISSE, we\xe2\x80\x99re expecting some degradation of sales which declined 8.1% in Q3 in dollars. In Japan, we\xe2\x80\x99re delighted that LATISSE marketed as GLASH VISTA has been launched through our aesthetics sales force in a co-promotion and partnership with Shionogi. 
I\xe2\x80\x99ll now pass it on to Jim Hindman who will comment our financial performance in further detail.
James H. Hindman 
During the third quarter of 2014 Allergan continued to showcase the strength of its sustainable business model by continuing to produce strong sales and earnings performance, being able to overachieve our sales and earnings per share guidance per quarter is a reflection of the depth and breadth of Allergan\xe2\x80\x99s business and our leading competitive positions within each of our specialty areas of focus and within each of our geographies. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2014 were $1.78 with growth of 44.7% compared to the third quarter of 2013. A reconciliation of all the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, amortization of acquired intangibles and discontinued operations, Allergan\xe2\x80\x99s Q3 2014 record high gross margin of 88.5% increased 110 basis points when compared to Q3 of the prior year driven primarily by favorable pricing, positive royalty dynamics as well as regional and product mix. 
The non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio from continuing operations for the third quarter 2014 was 34.5% totaling $618 million. This represents an increase in spend of approximately $35 million and a 360 basis point decline compared to the same quarter of 2013 and reflects our commitment to expense controls and targeted approach to investments into the areas of our business with the most promising financial returns. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 14.9% of product net sales for the quarter totaling $267 million, an increase in spend of approximately $16 million over the $251 million or 16.4% of product net sales spent in the third quarter of 2013. Please note the benefits from Allergan\xe2\x80\x99s previously announced restructuring program will be reflected in the company\xe2\x80\x99s actual results beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing through 2015.
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 49 days while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 132 days. The decrease in DSO compared to the third quarter of 2013 is due to the broad based improvements across all of our operating regions in particular, in North America. Important to note with respect to the US wholesaler inventory levels, we have a policy to maintain an amount less than eight weeks of our net sales. As of September 30
Due to the continuing negative data regarding the current state of Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s economy and exchange controls administered by the National Center for Foreign Commerce, we recorded a bad debt expense of approximately $37 million covering older receivables generated prior to October 2013. We\xe2\x80\x99re receiving payments on a regular basis for recent sales activity in 2014 which however, are lower than 2013 sales. 
In the third quarter operating cash flow after cap ex was approximately $519 million. On the year-to-date basis operating cash flow after cap ex was just over $1 billion. At the end of the third quarter Allergan\xe2\x80\x99s cash and equivalents in short term investments and cash and equivalents in short term investments net of debt positions totaled $4.2 billion and $2 billion respectively. 
With respect to our performance aspirations for the fourth quarter of 2014, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,845,000,000 to $1,920,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.80 to $1.83. Regarding full expectations for 2014, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $7,080,000,000 to $7,155,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $6.27 to $6.30. I think David may have referred to that was 2015, just to clarify that is our 2014 guidance. 
Our product net sales expectations reflect the continued negative impact of the strengthening dollar in the fourth quarter of 2014. As a reminder, the earnings per share expectations assume that the US R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2014 with the full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. This generated a higher effective tax rate in the first three quarters of 2014 and thus lower EPS results in those quarters while benefiting both the Q4 effective tax rate and reported Q4 EPS. Our current estimate of the full year earnings per share impact of this is between $0.05 and $0.06.
For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in the current release. With that operator, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to open the call to questions.

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Larry Biegelsen \xe2\x80\x93 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.
Larry Biegelsen \xe2\x80\x93 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.
On the last call, you said you can complete a deal before the December 18
David E. I. Pyott 
Well, I think if we sort of step back from everything, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recollect that way back in May we talked about all the different levers that are available to us to increase stockholder value. I think the most important one is our internal organic ability to do such. I think beyond the really tremendous increase in earnings and also the outlook for earnings not just for 2014 but carrying over into \xe2\x80\x9915, \xe2\x80\x9916, and well beyond in our five year plan, I\xe2\x80\x99d point out that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to raise the top end of sales guidance for the full year in the range of about $200 million.
So it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to answer your question in the framework of internal value creation. Beyond that, of course, we\xe2\x80\x99ve always pointed to the options available for further increasing value by deploying our balance sheet. Of course, given the passage of time, you\xe2\x80\x99d appreciate that some conversations may have been initiated long ago, and so therefore from the outside it is very difficult for you to determine just where we are in the process, if indeed we are looking at making strategic acquisition that fulfills very stringent criteria for value creation.
I think you said it well in terms of what are the rules regarding shareholder votes. I would also point out that some stockholders have been vocal, but we of course, speak to all of our stockholders and very many of them in private have expressed very different views. In fact, being highly supportive of value creation moves by deploying our balance sheet.

Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Deutsche Bank.
Gregg Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Deutsche Bank
Just a follow up on the M&A question. The street has been pretty focused on the concept that if you\xe2\x80\x99d been pursuing an acquisition, you\xe2\x80\x99d likely announce it by today so that shareholders of record would have an alternative to consider at the December 18 vote. That seems a little simplistic to me, but I\xe2\x80\x99m curious on your thoughts around that concept and what do you think the outlook is for a significant acquisition given that you know more than we do on the outside on that subject?
David E. I. Pyott 
Clearly, stockholders have an opportunity to vote through the purchase and sale of stock at any moment, and I think the rules around voting have been extremely well discussed by both sell-side analysts as well as in the media, and the majority of the reports have been accurate. So, beyond just repeating what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know how I would add and give you any more color on the state of play. 
The only thing I would like to reiterate again is that we have very stringent criteria in terms of looking at specialty businesses that fit, that have long-term good growth prospects on the top line as well as ability to deliver bottom line results and therefore returns well in excess of the cost of capital. Those we\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed time and time again not just during this process since April 22, but indeed over the last couple of years. Really, in terms of our criteria, I\xe2\x80\x99ve often stressed nothing has changed at all.

Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez \xe2\x80\x93 Leerink Swann.
Seamus Fernandez \xe2\x80\x93 Leerink Swann
Can you just give us your general thoughts a little bit more on the timeframe within which you believe an all cash acquisition could be executed should you choose to find an asset that actually fits in that timeframe. As just a little clarification there, if we were to not see an announcement up to the early December timeframe, is an all cash acquisition at that point in time still a possibility without a shareholder vote?
David E. I. Pyott 
I think the way I\xe2\x80\x99d answer that is clearly if there were to be a transaction, it would have to be announced somewhere in the early part of December so that stockholders would have adequate time to assess how they gauge the value of that particular option. I think also as we\xe2\x80\x99ve stated in the past, I should add another point which is, should we not have announced a transaction, many stockholders have told us that they would then believe that we should go to, in their view, the second choice, the second preference which would be to consider a stock repurchase program. I just want to make sure in the full balance that all of those options are on the table and are in the public view of our stockholders.

Your next question comes from David Maris \xe2\x80\x93 BMO Capital Markets.
David Maris \xe2\x80\x93 BMO Capital Markets
A couple of questions, first a couple of weeks ago Ackman said he found evidence that would come out in the next few days, so that was on the 16
David E. I. Pyott 
I think we will sort of answer two of those questions, particularly as one is about the business which is kind of encouraging on a quarterly earnings call. So on the first one, in terms of the two and fro with [inaudible] and Valeant, I think to make it very clear, our goal in all of this is to make sure that stockholders and the public have accurate data available for making their assessment on true performance. Also, last week in an effort to show exactly that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing everything properly, we chose to release some emails which had to that moment been redacted.
I would now like to pass it over to Scott on the [bimatoprost].
Scott M. Whitcup, M.D. 
We\xe2\x80\x99ve been focusing a lot of our glaucoma pipeline efforts on sustained release as you know. Compliance is a big issue with patients, especially older patients who have difficulty taking drops. Our most advanced sustained release program is by [bimatoprost], the active ingredient in LUMIGAN in a micro implant that can be placed in the eye in an in office procedure. We believe that it will control IOP for at least four months.
The exciting news is we\xe2\x80\x99ve met with FDA and planned to start Phase III study for this bimatorpost sustained release implant by end of this year and we will present data on the Phase II program probably at a meeting next year once we figure out which meeting we\xe2\x80\x99ll let everybody know. But it\xe2\x80\x99s an exciting program with good data and FDA go ahead to get to Phase III which again, we plan to start this year.

Your next question comes from Aaron Gal \xe2\x80\x93 Bernstein Research.
Aaron Gal \xe2\x80\x93 Bernstein Research
The question is two-fold, first can you just give us an update on your efforts to separate BOTOX aesthetics from BOTOX therapeutics because as this is kind of like a major potential [inaudible]. Second, could you explain to us how the cost cuts you are putting now in place differ from the classic way from which Valeant approaches the business simply because we get into the argument that those cost cuts are essentially the same thing?
David E. I. Pyott 
In terms of formal separation of pricing in the US, really no major progress made there. The only thing I can comment is obviously we were able to take a price increase at the beginning of 2014 which was the first time, I believe, for about seven years. So some ability to raise price on both sides of the equation therapeutic and aesthetic. In terms of cost reduction, I think you should see it in the right context that our level of price cuts were in the 30% type of range \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, beg your pardon, and so really based no extremely detailed knowledge of our business we know very, very well things that are absolutely core to driving long term growth, which programs if you look in any portfolio, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s investments or stock investments for investment analysts of in terms of us investing in the long term growth of the business, we know just where to reduce. 
In fact, I knew my number was wrong. Our operational efficiencies were a 13% reduction across the board where going back to the Valeant offer, they were proposing at the outset a 70% decrease in our operating costs so very, very different. As I think is demonstrated by the trajectory of the sales, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to trim and cut in the right places and we believe reiterating the numbers in our five year strategic plan we can continue after these cuts to grow the top line annually in excess of 10% annually.
So we believe we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to trim at the margin without impacting the ability to grow topline for the long term.
James H. Hindman 
I think the important thing in this is that we know our business and through rewiring and efficiencies we knew where to go to get those costs out without significantly affecting the topline. So that\xe2\x80\x99s really the key here.

Your next question comes from David Buck \xe2\x80\x93 Buckingham Research Group.
David Buck \xe2\x80\x93 Buckingham Research Group
These will be non-fundamental to your business I guess, but I guess one line of questioning, for the potential to talk with Valeant, what level of compensation of shareholders would trigger you being more active and engaged in discussing their proposal? When do we get an answer on whether one of your shareholders may be precluded from voting their shares?
David E. I. Pyott 
I think behind your question really is the answer that all of our efforts are focused on how to increase value for our stockholders. Clearly, the board has in the past been clear that the offer substantially undervalued the company. I think today, all we saw really was an offer to negotiate, there was not a formal increase in the offer price. It was difficult to really discern exactly what was going on in there but I would assume that there was an assumed increase in the Valeant stock price to corroborate those numbers. Obviously, our board will think about what this letter meant and in due course we\xe2\x80\x99ll make a determination and respond.

Your next question comes from Shibani Malhotra \xe2\x80\x93 Sterne Agee.
Shibani Malhotra \xe2\x80\x93 Sterne Agee
First, can you explain \xe2\x80\x93 I guess a lot of investors were worried that with all the news around the Allergan Valeant sort of merger takeover operations might suffer because your people might be kind of disturb, etc., but can you explain how performance has been so strong regardless of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the bigger picture? Then the second question obviously, we believe that Allergan has numerous options beyond Valeant alone and you talked about Allergan is a standalone and potentially being acquirer or use of your balance sheet, but can you also talk about the potential for deals with other companies, perhaps a friendly merger and how you would think about the different options that are available to you right now?
David E. I. Pyott 
I think to the credit of our management team and our employees worldwide, they\xe2\x80\x99ve remained extraordinarily focused on delivering results and therefore, in its essence further creation of stockholder value. Right from the beginning, I made it very clear to our team that a very small group of us would be involved in dealing with all the ramifications of the Valeant and Pershing Square offer. That number of people is certainly less than 10 at any one given time then the other 11,000 employees spend their time on delivering value whether it be through the R&D pipeline, whether it be through service to our physician customers and their patients. I think we can see that has worked extraordinarily well.
In terms of options, let me always repeat the same thing, we are open to whatever makes strategic sense to create further value for stockholders. That can be the whole myriad of different options in terms of deploying our balance sheet and equally of course, we\xe2\x80\x99re very much open to listening to other company\xe2\x80\x99s offers. If at the right time they would make greater sense, have greater value than Valeant\xe2\x80\x99s offer than that\xe2\x80\x99s something of course, our board would very fully consider.

Liav Abraham \xe2\x80\x93 Citi Research
Another question on your fundamental revenue outlook, I guess my question is what\xe2\x80\x99s changed since the beginning of the year? You gave guidance around 10% product sales growth in February, now this is around 14% to 15% for the full year. Where were you wrong, what has surprised you and how sustainable is this longer term given that your longer term guidance is for revenue growth in the 10% range? Is there potential upside to that?
David E. I. Pyott 
I think where I would start is as I stated in my very early parts of my remarks, markets in which we operate have been very strong indeed. So there\xe2\x80\x99s a good general backdrop. I think within our product lines where we\xe2\x80\x99ve done extraordinarily well is that the dermal fillers have frankly exceeded our expectations. It would have been difficult the beginning of the year to say, \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, in Q3 we will grow the business worldwide in excess of [50%],\xe2\x80\x9d which is exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done.
So really, this has been the value of the VYCROSS line, 
Then I think within eye care, RESTASIS continues to grow very strongly not only in value but more importantly in really I\xe2\x80\x99ll call it cases because when you look at prescriptions and trailing prescriptions it actually slightly understates the growth because people are filling larger and larger quantities per prescription. Then also overseas we\xe2\x80\x99ve done very well with glaucoma. You can see despite the challenges of the US market, I refer quarter-after-quarter to double digit growth for the bimatoprost franchise 
Then if we look at the US dermatology business now on the medical side, really great performance particularly by ACZONE but also TAZORAC. So pretty broad suites of products that are doing better than we had really planned and budgeted at the beginning of the year and thankfully our employees have really remained focused on driving this healthy growth which should last for long periods of time.

Marc Goodman \xe2\x80\x93 UBS Securities, LLC.
Can you talk about BOTOX specifically in migraine and overactive bladder and maybe help us get a sense of where the growth is coming from? Are these new patients coming in, are they patients that are staying on therapy longer, are you getting new doctors on board? Just help us understand where all the growth is coming from.
David E. I. Pyott 
Well, in addition to the two conditions that you mentioned, I would also like to stress that the base movement disorders business, thanks to the more recent approvals of both upper limb spasticity in the US and now most recently some country approvals for lower limb spasticity, they\xe2\x80\x99re also driving growth. So stepping back above all of that, I would say we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to add new doctors or new injectors but really probably more important at this stage is how do we make each individual doctor that has been trained adequately on how to administer the product become more productive 
Clearly, any physicians that has to inject and particularly if they\xe2\x80\x99re buying and billing, they stay out-of-pocket for close to $1,000. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t get paid by the insurance carrier that is a true negative. So we\xe2\x80\x99re making sure those experiences are few and far between and the physician becomes good not only at injecting but the whole patient flow through the practice all the way through to reimbursement. Then of course, appropriately bringing that patient back into the practice for repeat injections.
Clearly, that\xe2\x80\x99s always what we always call in marketing the leaky bucket theory to the degree we can really avoid that drop off of people who just fail to show up again for the right treatment at the right time. We\xe2\x80\x99ll never make it perfect, but how do we optimize it increasingly?
James H. Hindman 
You can see it\xe2\x80\x99s a very complex model so all those pieces need to fit together so it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about adding more sales force, you have to have a deep knowledge of the business and then be able to work all those pieces together.

Ken Cacciatore \xe2\x80\x93 Cowen & Company
I just wanted to ask specifically, did you receive an all cash offer from another party other than Valeant and what is the board\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary duty if you are dealing with two offers, at what point does the board need to decide to listen or engage, even at a minimal level?
David E. I. Pyott 
Well of course, I can never really comment any particular market rumors so I think I need to put a stake in the ground there. After that, of course, as I answered in several of the questions earlier, the only thing that our board is focused on is discharge of our fiduciary duties and a deep analysis of what is the intrinsic value of our company where we\xe2\x80\x99re supported by two investment banks and we use all the normal valuation criteria to come up with ranges of value that we believe we represent.
Going back to what I\xe2\x80\x99ve stated earlier, as the year has progressed we have been constantly not only accelerating sales growth but steadily increasing our actual delivery of earnings per share but also our outlook for earnings per share. As you well know from us, when we state a number we absolutely mean it and if you think back over a very long period of time, we have never missed a number. So I\xe2\x80\x99d like to say that there\xe2\x80\x99s a very high degree of certainty when we give you numbers.
So, that\xe2\x80\x99s the intrinsic valuation and of course, to the degree there are offers from third-parties we have to evaluate them with the support of our advisors in the appropriate manner and of course, we will always be focused on how do we deliver value to our stockholders.

Your next question comes from Annabel Samimy \xe2\x80\x93 Stifel Nicolaus. 
Annabel Samimy \xe2\x80\x93 Stifel Nicolaus
I guess the first relates to your capital allocation, a lot of people have been focusing on possible M&A targets larger companies, but is there a possibility that you\xe2\x80\x99re considering a combination of smaller companies and various capital allocation plans with regard to shareholder stock buyback or a special dividend? Just if you could review possibly your priorities in terms of those very specific criteria that you look at for M&A, whether they need to be immediately accretive or not. The second thing is other OZURDEX is starting from a very nice base and I just want to get a sense of how much of that right now has been off label in DME and can you sort of quantify for us the 40% of patients who are not responsive to VEGF and how much of VEGF right now is used in DME.
David E. I. Pyott 
Clearly, in terms of our multiple options in theory of course, there could be a smaller type of acquisition. I think in the past I\xe2\x80\x99ve used very illustrative numbers of $10 billion for a larger acquisition, let\xe2\x80\x99s just call between one is between zero and 10 is $5 billion and then you could do that kind of acquisition topped by a stock buyback or a special dividend. So that\xe2\x80\x99s another way of creating value through deployment of our balance sheet.
I\xe2\x80\x99ll move on then rapidly to OZURDEX, as I stated, year-to-date sales for the first time we\xe2\x80\x99ve given you the number it\xe2\x80\x99s $117 million with growth over 30% year-over-year. I would think that the amount of off label use, particularly in the US was extremely limited because physicians appropriately are concerned about getting reimbursed by their insurance carriers. Most retina specialists are on the buy and bill model and therefore getting the label initially approved was really important and now thanks to Scott Whitcup\xe2\x80\x99s work with the FDA and his ability to remove the restrictions, that has been just a major point. Scott something to add?
Scott M. Whitcup, M.D. 
The question that you brought on responsiveness, there are several studies that show that although the anti-VEGF agents work well in a lot of patients with diabetic macular edema there is still a significant number of patients and depending on the study, up to 30% to 40% who don\xe2\x80\x99t get complete resolution of the fluid in the retina with the anti-VEGF\xe2\x80\x99s and we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from multiple physicians that there is clearly an unmet need for additional therapy in diabetic macular edema and that our data shows that OZURDEX is a great alternative therapy to the anti-VEGF\xe2\x80\x99s and we think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be clearly the biggest indication that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had for OZURDEX to date.
David E. I. Pyott 
I should add on the acquisition side, clearly one of the criteria would be that an acquisition would be accretive ideally in its first year and then growing beyond that.

Andrew Finkelstein \xe2\x80\x93 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLP
I was hoping you could comment a little bit about how you evaluate what could be a fluctuating value of an offer from Valeant or another party if stock is a component and how that might influence the decision about what is greater shareholder value than an independent strategy? Then on the results from the quarter, whether there were any moving parts we should understand regarding stocking, promotions, growth-to-net adjustments? In particular, it seemed like the glaucoma products has the biggest upgrade to the full year outlook whereas RESTASIS was up quarter-on-quarter but implying a rather large step up into the fourth quarter, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen strong RX trends there but what influences some of these quarter-to-quarter swings?
David E. I. Pyott 
Answering the first part on terms of how does the board supported by its advisors value an offer, well I suppose like all of us or you, we have to see what is the current implied value of a stock price. Beyond that, we are obviously looking at the intrinsic value of the company and certainly as of last week, because we have not yet made it as a board a decision on this latest letter, clearly as of last week the offer on the table substantially undervalued the company. So it is not a very long or difficult exercise. This current offer, as I said, which is really an offer to negotiate because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t state is there an increase in the cash offer, is there a difference in the exchange offer, it is more just a statement of faith, we will respond to that. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s ask Jim to answer some questions in terms of the outlook we provided in our guidance. 
James H. Hindman 
If you take a look at the Q3 results there is really nothing out of the ordinary as we went through it. I think the one thing to remember is from a wholesaler inventory level, I think I had mentioned what our targets are and we\xe2\x80\x99re at the low end of our stated policy there so there was nothing related to inventory, wholesaler inventory, or increased rebates, or anything from that perspective. That would be out of the normal.
I think as you look into the fourth quarter everything again is pretty straightforward. The only thing I think I had mentioned overall from a tax basis is that you\xe2\x80\x99ll see we\xe2\x80\x99re assuming the R&D tax credit gets passed in the fourth quarter which would cause a catch up entry to be made in the fourth quarter for that. But other than that I think everything is pretty straightforward in what we\xe2\x80\x99ve disclosed.

I think most of us on the call are surprised that three months have gone by since the last quarter call where a huge focus was on BD activity, nothing has happened. Clearly, there could still be something that happens, only you would know that not us but obviously, the clock is ticking towards the December 18
David E. I. Pyott 
Well, I think if you go back to three months ago what our action demonstrates is that Allergan is extremely disciplined in terms of how we evaluate options and as I\xe2\x80\x99ve stated, there are multiple options and we plan to deliver greater value to our stockholders. So let me reiterate it\xe2\x80\x99s through organic action and delivery of value, it could be through strategic transactions, it could be through other forms of capital activity in the form of buyback and indeed, as I stated earlier, if another party or parties which to put in an increased offer on the table that is substantially superior to Valeant\xe2\x80\x99s that is something our board, of course, in its pursuit of value for stockholders should and would consider.

Regarding cost cutting, what is the extent to which you can cut further, or I guess another way of asking, are the efficiencies that you announced earlier this year, should we think of that as sort of the beginning of longer term efficiency initiatives or is this essentially a one-time action?
David E. I. Pyott 
Let me reiterate what I stated in my prepared remarks that we have really defined all of the actions we wish to take. As we\xe2\x80\x99ve stated publically these numbers in terms of the value or the cuts they deliver are $475 million. Maybe on the inside we can do fractionally better than that but we\xe2\x80\x99ll comment this as time goes on. Basically, the announcements have been made. We\xe2\x80\x99ve completed this and I made the comment we\xe2\x80\x99re now ready to move onto the next stage which is focus on delivery of sales growth and deliver this plan. So this is not just the beginning, this is the end of our cost cuts and you can see that we have been able to drive enormous growth and are confident we will do so in future.
