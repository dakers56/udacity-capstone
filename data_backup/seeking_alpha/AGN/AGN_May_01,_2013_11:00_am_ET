Hello, and welcome to the Allergan First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today\'s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
I would like to introduce today\'s conference host, Mr. Jim Hindman, Senior Vice President, Treasury, Risk and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
James M. Hindman
Thank you, Christie. Good morning. With me for today\'s conference call is David Pyott, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Edwards, Executive Vice President, Finance and Business Development, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Scott Whitcup, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer, who is joining us from Washington, D.C. where he\'ll be attending the VOLUMA FDA panel tomorrow; and Jim Barlow, Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller.

At this point, I would like to turn the call over to David Pyott.
David E. I. Pyott
Thank you, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. In the first quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the first quarter of 2012 by 9.0% in local currencies and by 8.4% in U.S. dollars, even with a typically low sales growth of ophthalmic pharmaceuticals at 3.2% in local currencies.
Regarding operating performance, we generated non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.98 from continuing operations, excluding the benefit of the retroactive R&D tax credit for 2012, which was received in January 2013. This marked an increase of 18% compared to Q1 of 2012 and is well above the first quarter outlook we gave in the range of $0.94 to $0.96 and was achieved after we invested $249 million into R&D, strongly increasing 13% year-over-year.
For reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please consult our press release.
Before I provide commentary on the performance of our various businesses, we\'d like to provide an update on some important Phase II programs in our R&D portfolio.
Regarding DARPin, Allergan has completed the initial analysis for the second stage of the randomized controlled Phase II trial comparing 2 doses of the anti-VEGF DARPin and ranibizumab, i.e. LUCENTIS. The data suggest some product differentiation between the DARPin and LUCENTIS but do not support directly moving to Phase III. Instead, we plan to perform additional Phase II work to more completely access safety and efficacy and to guide the Phase III study design. This will likely delay eventual approval by approximately 1 to 2 years compared to starting a Phase III program by the end of 2013.
As previously communicated, data from this Phase II trial will be presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology Retina Subspecialty Day in November.
Regarding Bimatoprost Scalp hair growth, the results of the Phase II trial in male and female hair loss indicated that the formulation was well-tolerated but did not provide sufficient efficacy to proceed directly to Phase III. As a consequence, we are extending the Phase II program to include trials with an approximately tenfold higher concentration of bimatoprost in the current formulation and also in an oval formulation. These trials will start enrolling male patients with androgenic alopecia in the third quarter of 2013.
Now moving onto the business performance. Commencing with ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, year-over-year sales growth was below the long-term trend line and was at 3.2% in local currencies and 2.5% in dollars. This was primarily due to the LUMIGAN franchise declining 5.7% in local currencies caused by LUMIGAN declines in the U.S. and Latin America and offset by strong double-digit growth in the emerging markets of the European, Africa, Middle East region.
Latin America is broadly attributable to the timing of the Easter week in 2013, with Easter falling in March in 2013 and April in 2012. Performance in the U.S. was affected both by reduction in channel inventory of LUMIGAN 0.03%, both at wholesale and more importantly at retail, where we have limited visibility. We announced the discontinuation of LUMIGAN 0.03% in August and ceased shipping to wholesale in December. As of the week ending April 19, 94% of trailing prescriptions for LUMIGAN were written for the newer and improved LUMIGAN 0.01% product.
When we discontinued ALPHAGAN P 0.15% several years ago, you will recollect that we experienced some of these same retail inventory dislocations. We expect most of this retail inventory to be rebuilt in the second half of this year with LUMIGAN 0.01%, although we will obviously occupy less shelf space with 1 product versus 2.
End market in the U.S., IMS for the quarter ending March shows overall strong Allergan eye care growth at 14.5% in acquisition dollars, and also Allergan gaining the greatest market share for any company. Approximately, LUMIGAN increased sales year-over-year by 8.6% in acquisition dollars. LUMIGAN sales growth is composed of a 1.8% decline in trailing prescriptions written and then offset by 16.6% in total price increases to U.S. wholesale. For 2014, we are confident that LUMIGAN will continue to be in a strong position on Part D formularies.
Regarding RESTASIS in the United States, we\'re continuing to enjoy volume growth at around 10% year-over-year, further boosted by 2 price increases totaling 10.3%. Beyond broader physician adoption and earlier treatment of therapeutic dry eye, consumer awareness is being successfully driven by an increased investment in DTC. OZURDEX growth continues on a sharp trajectory, driven particularly by Europe and the U.S.
Regarding global reports for Q4, the last period for which data is available, IMS reports the world market growing a robust 12%, buoyed by retinal therapeutics with the glaucoma market growing only 2%, given the impact of latanoprost and other generics. For Allergan, IMS reported for Q4 12% global growth and also 12% in the glaucoma category, with steady share gains in not only glaucoma but also allergy and retina.
Regarding regulatory action, OZURDEX received reimbursement in Turkey and Korea and was approved for retinal vein occlusion in Thailand and in India for uveitis. Additionally, LUMIGAN unit dose was approved in Canada and LASTACAFT in Ukraine, Serbia and Singapore. OZURDEX was also launched in South Africa.
Moving onto BOTOX. Sales in Q1 grew year-over-year 15.4% in local currencies and 14.8% in dollars, with double-digit growth in both the therapeutic and aesthetic franchises. Regarding the global market in Q4, the last period for which we have data available, we estimate the growth was 14%, with Allergan outperforming the market at 16%. Accordingly, BOTOX market share moved up to 78% from 76% in Q4 of 2011.
Since the last earnings call, we have received additional country approvals for chronic migraine: in Spain, including reimbursement, Finland, Greece, Croatia, Ukraine and Mexico; for neurogenic bladder in Spain, again, including reimbursement, Italy, Greece, Croatia, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Hong Kong and Peru; and for overactive bladder in Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Spain and Malta.
The U.S. therapeutic business continued on a strong trajectory, driven by chronic migraine, the 2 urology indications and upper limb spasticity. Regarding chronic migraine, commercial access is virtually complete, and patients without access are at a low level. Regarding training, the greatest emphasis is on enhancing injector expertise and increasing productivity in individual practices. Both physicians and their patients report very high levels of satisfaction with BOTOX.
In Neurology, where obviously it\'s an earlier stage of adoption and also training for newest idiopathic overactive bladder indication, where we received approval from FDA in January. Since approval of neurogenic overactive bladder, we have now trained over 2,400 unique urologists in a target universe of 5,500 urologists and urologists/gynecologist. Insurance coverage in neurogenic is excellent at 100% of Medicare lives and at 88% of commercial lives.
Regarding the newer idiopathic indication, we\'re still establishing policy coverage. This is increasing rapidly. But as of March, just 2 months after approval, it was only 16% of commercial lives and 40% of Medicare lives. Consequently, the biggest barrier to adoption is lack of patient access. In terms of the prior authorization process, it is however encouraging that only about 10% of insurance verifications for overactive bladder, that\'s the idiopathic one, are denied.
Outside the U.S., BOTOX for neurogenic overactive bladder is now covered in the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Alberta and British Colombia. In Europe, we are pleased that with reinvigorated management, we have now started to regain overall market share in the therapeutic segment as we move to establish BOTOX in chronic migraine and urology in those countries where we have secured government reimbursement. In Q1, the neurogenic bladder indication was launched in the U.K. and idiopathic in Germany.
Turning to the aesthetic side of the BOTOX business. We enjoyed strong growth in Q1 in most of the principal markets of the world. In the U.S., based on survey data, we believe that the neuromodulator market is growing high single-digits and that BOTOX share was at 82% in March, an increase of 5 share points versus a year earlier, given that this was before the injunction issued against Merz.
After its reintroduction, Xeomin share is increasing only slowly as physicians seem to appreciate the difference in duration between BOTOX and Xeomin, both per their respective FDA labels, as well as in clinical practice. Xeomin share in March was estimated at 5%, and Dysport share dropped to 13% from 16% in March of 2012. Regarding illegal imports of BOTOX, we are pleased that FDA has conducted 2 regulatory actions in January and now again in April.
Across the European Union, it appears that the market is continuing to grow double digit despite the economic malaise and that we have stabilized BOTOX share after the launches of Bocouture and Azzalure.
Facial aesthetics enjoyed extremely robust growth of 32.9% in local currencies and almost the same in dollars at 32.6%, with very strong increases in all operating regions of the world.
Whilst market growth is strong, a few factors flatter the year-over-year x factory increases. U.S. x factory sales were affected by the buy-in against the 3% JUV\xc3\x89DERM price increase posted on March 16, the sell-in of our proven results, rebate promotion in combination with BOTOX, as well as the lower quarter [ph] in 2012, which was a period between 2 of the then promotions called Duet Dividends. Hence, you should expect moderate year-over-year growth in Q2 of this year.
In terms of consumption in the U.S., we estimate that the dermal filler market growth continued in the high single-digits. JUV\xc3\x89DERM market share was stable year-over-year with Restylane share losses being picked up by Belotero for Merz.
This week, we are eagerly awaiting the FDA panel for VOLUMA. Based on worldwide experience, the introduction of VOLUMA leads to a large increase in the volumizing segment of the market.
Canada also sold in a similar rebate promotion to the U.S. in Q1, ahead of the expected approval of Dysport cosmetic by Valeant. In addition, Canada launched VOLBELLA in April.
In the European Union, the dermal filler market is growing high single-digits despite challenging economic conditions for consumers. Allergan is dramatically outpacing the market, fully benefiting from the innovation of our Vycross platform, initially with VOLUMA and now VOLBELLA, the latter which is used primarily in the lips.
At the Antiaging Medicine World Congress in Monaco in April, we launched VOLIFT for nasolabial folds, a product with superior malleability. Latin America and Asia Pacific were also propelled by VOLUMA and were available by the new members of the Vycross family. Since the last earnings call, we received approval for VOLBELLA and VOLIFT in Argentina.
Breast aesthetics sales declined 8.5% in local currencies and by 8.9% in dollars. This is a break in trends from the global market growth of 8% that we estimated for the full year in 2012 and Allergan\'s 2012 end-market growth of 8%.
The poor first quarter is attributable to several factors: firstly, weak market conditions in the U.S. in Q1, where we estimate that the market in procedures declined 4% year-over-year, exacerbated by share loss. Sientra now has 5% to 6% share against a 0 base in Q1 of 2012. While 2/3 of Sientra\'s gain seems to stem from Mentor, Allergan still suffered a 1-share-point loss.
Whilst we\'re delighted to have the approval of the Natrelle Shaped Anatomical 410 Implant as unique differentiated product, sales in the quarter were modest as we demand rigorous online certification by surgeons before they conduct their first surgery.
So that was the first factor. Secondly, the lapping effect of the PIP scandal in Europe and to a lesser extent in Latin America a year ago. Q1 2012 sales increased dramatically versus Q1 of 2011 with 18% in local currencies. Allergan at the time, with its premium positioning and quality, benefited disproportionately in these revision surgeries, as well as for first time choice for augmentation.
Then the third factor was timing of shipments to certain distributors and revenue recognition depressed sales. Across 21 countries in the European Union, per a syndicated market data in Q4, the last period for which data is available, the market grew 9% in volume, with Allergan gaining share and growing in the low double-digits. Surprisingly, both the Italian and Spanish markets grew double digits in Q4 year-over-year.
During the course of the remainder of 2013, we remain confident about resumption of normal growth and points where our forecast growth for the full year in a range of 3.4% to 11.4%. Growth will also be enhanced by the recent launches of 410 in the U.S. and Korea and shortly by the introduction of round responsive implants in Japan.
In terms of our last category, called skin care and other, this franchise grew 19.5% in dollars. Residual sales of SANCTURA XR are inside this number and were $12 million lower than Q1 of 2012, with skin care growing almost 40%, boosted by the first-time contribution of our SkinMedica acquisition.
We are, however, also pleased with the dramatic increase in sales of ACZONE, as well as the resumption TAZORAC growth. In terms of acquisition dollars reported by IMS for Q1, ACZONE grew year-over-year by 46% and TAZORAC by 7%, with TAZORAC representing the only growing brand in the single agent retinal [ph] class.
LATISSE sales increased 7.2% in local currencies and 6.9% in dollars. In the U.S., we benefited from the mix switch to the larger 5-ml size; a mid-March price increase; and a federal court injunction against Athena\'s RevitaLash, the largest of the infringing products. x U.S., we enjoyed increasing sales in Canada, Asia and Latin America. LATISSE was furthermore approved in Thailand. During the remainder of the year, LATISSE is expected to benefit from the expanded SkinMedica sales force for whom LATISSE is a key product in its portfolio.
I\'ll now pass it over to Jeff Edwards, who has further commentary regarding our financial performance.
Jeffrey L. Edwards
Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. First quarter of 2013 represented a good start to the year for Allergan as we were able to overachieve EPS expectations even as we continue to support our objective of reinvesting into our present and future growth drivers of the business across the commercial portfolio and our pipeline.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2013 were $0.98, with growth of 18% compared to the first quarter of 2012 from continuing operations. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in the earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, amortization of acquired intangibles and discontinued operations, Allergan\'s Q1 2013 gross margin of 86.7% increased 100 basis points when compared to Q1 2012. This year-over-year improvement in gross margin is driven by a number of variables but primarily attributable to positive royalty dynamics, favorable region and product line mix and a decrease in provisions for inventory reserves.
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio from continuing operations for the first quarter was 41%, totaling $587 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2012 were 41.9% and $554 million, respectively.
Although there was an increase in spend as measured in dollars consistent with our strategy, the related absolute year-over-year percentage increase of the spend trails the rate of growth of net sales over the same period. We continue to implement targeted investments to further support our future growth and support the launch of many products approved over the last 3 years.
The primary drivers of the increase in spend during the quarter relate to the acquisition of SkinMedica, ongoing investments in high-growth Asia-Pacific and European emerging markets, such as China and Russian, and the wraparound effect of the modest expansion of our U.S. neurosciences sales organization later last year.
As historically is the case, Allergan\'s SG&A expenses to product net sales ratio tends to be higher in the first half of the year and moderates during the back half of the year. Our expectation for 2013 is consistent with this historic theme: non-GAAP research and development expenses were 17.4% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $249 million, an increase in spend of approximately $29 million over the $220 million or 16.6% of product net sales spent in the first quarter of 2012.
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan sales outstanding was 57 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 123 days.
In the first quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $96 million. The decrease in cash flow was primarily due to the effect of balance sheet changes, particularly for accounts receivable and payable; income taxes and accrued liabilities, which should substantially reverse themselves as the year progresses.
At the end of the first quarter, Allergan\'s cash and equivalents and short-term investments and cash and equivalents and short-term investments, net of debt, positions total approximately $2.2 billion and $84 million, respectively. It is worth noting that approximately $960 million of Allergan\'s cash was utilized prior to the end of the first quarter to complete the acquisition of MAP Pharmaceuticals.
We also issued approximately $600 million of new long-term debt at a weighted average rate of approximately 2.19% in the first quarter of 2013 to help offset the use of cash and equivalents of the recent acquisitions of SkinMedica and MAP Pharmaceuticals.
With respect to the stock purchase, the company has completed its 10b5-1 plan involving 6 million shares for 2013, with a focus of offsetting the dilutive effect of share-based employee compensation plans.
As we move towards the second half of the year, we may purchase additional shares above the 6 million as mentioned previously to offset potential dilution from the sale of the obesity intervention business.
For the second quarter of 2013, Allergan estimates product mixed sales in the range of $1,500,000,000 to $1,575,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.20, including the dilutive impact of the MAP acquisition.
Regarding full year expectations for 2013, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,975,000,000 to $6,200,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.76, which excludes the impact of the 2012 R&D tax credit reported in Q1 2013 of the non-GAAP adjustment and includes the $0.07 estimated dilution impact related to the MAP Pharmaceuticals acquisition.
For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in the current release.
So with that, operator, I\'d now like to open the call to questions.
Operator
Today\'s conference call is scheduled to conclude at 9:00 a.m. Pacific time. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.
Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I guess we have to start with the DARPin. Can you just give us a little bit more information about the DARPin. It sounds from the way you described it that the problem was primarily around the efficacy. Can you confirm that? And can you, more importantly perhaps for the franchise, confirm what are the safety profile of the product now that it\'s produced in the million sales is actually good enough to make it through commercialization?
David E. I. Pyott
Scott, every time I\'ll pass the question to you. Because as we announced, separately, Scott is in Washington, D.C., getting ready for the VOLUMA panel. So Scott, if you\'d answer those please?
Scott M. Whitcup
Sure. So Ronny, we\'ve just completed initial analysis, the existing second stage of the Phase II is ongoing. What I can tell you, as David commented, we saw some product differentiation from LUCENTIS, which was the control in the second stage. And there was enough product differentiation to do more Phase II work and safety that we feel comfortable doing additional Phase II work. But since all the data aren\'t back and since it\'s more appropriate for you to see all the data together, those won\'t be available until, as David commented, Subspecialty Day -- Retina Subspecialty Day at the AAO.
Operator
Our next question is from Liav Abraham with Citi.
Liav Abraham - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Another question on the DARPin, please. Could you provide us some color on the timing and the design of the additional work that you need to do? When do you anticipate additional work to start, trial size, design? Are you still looking at Q 16 weeks as the potential end point?
David E. I. Pyott
Scott, if you want to take those, please?
Scott M. Whitcup
Sure. So this Phase II was designed so that we could have multiple stages. The current plan, because it will save us a fair bit of time, is to have a third stage of the existing Phase II study. It allows us to enroll patients more quickly. So the plan is to get that next phase of the Phase II amended and for patients to start probably as early as Q3 of this year. The study design, we\'re still meeting. And again, some of the analysis are still coming in. So those will guide exactly what the next stage of the Phase II looks like.
Operator
Our next question is from Marc Goodman with UBS Securities.
Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Another question on DARPin. I guess, Scott, my understanding is that scale-up was really the gating issue here and that you really couldn\'t start Phase III yet. You needed to figure out how to scale this product up, and you felt comfortable with your Phase II data. And the Phase IIb was really just -- because you had the time to do it, so why not do it? So it\'s kind of interesting that we\'ve gotten to this point. So I\'m kind of curious your thoughts about that. And secondly, is the duration of the product lasting out to 3-ish or 4-ish months, which is the hope and the hypothesis, that certainly you all had thought as you\'ve been talking about it for the past 4 or 5 months? Is that there or is it more of the efficacy, the vision improvement that\'s the gating issue that you\'re talking about where there\'s some differentiation versus LUCENTIS? But I\'m curious whether it\'s duration or efficacy.
David E. I. Pyott
Scott, you\'re the guy today.
Scott M. Whitcup
So Marc, let me just correct you on your initial piece. Although with any biologic, we continue to -- from the time we got the product from Molecular Partners, we did improve and changed the manufacturing, so there was some scale-up time. We did not have the clinical trial data in age-related macular degeneration prior to this Phase II. So this is the first data and control data in age-related macular degeneration. So even if we had a product, we would not have been ready prior. This Phase II had an initial stage, which was dose escalation, and then the second stage was the randomized controlled comparison to LUCENTIS. We still have the analysis coming in, so I can\'t comment. And it\'s best for you to see data at AAO with regards to visual acuity benefit and duration. We\'ll know even more by then. All we can say now is that we didn\'t have enough data from the second stage at the early 16-week initial analysis to finalize study design for Phase III. It needs more work.
Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
But if that\'s the case, I guess I\'m a little curious, why were you so bullish on this product 4 months ago, 5 months ago? It made it seem like you had enough data to be very bullish on the product and now you\'re kind of saying, "Well, maybe, we didn\'t have enough information?"
Scott M. Whitcup
Well, again, we had data, both preclinically and the initial data from Molecular Partners, that suggested product differentiation. The retina program, given that we want to go for AMD and diabetic macular edema, are hugely expensive. And you want the Phase III design to be optimized. And we\'re not going to launch into Phase III unless we\'re very sure of exact product differentiation and the exact dosing and interval and dose. And if we had those data early on, my goal is always to expedite programs. But this is a very expensive program, and we need to make sure that we have the right product differentiation and the right study design.
Operator
Our next question is from Jamie Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Scott, I don\'t mean to beat a dead horse, but if you could just provide us a little bit more color on what the magnitude of the benefit you saw over LUCENTIS. You said you did see that in some patients, maybe not in others. And what gives you confidence that the program will be delayed 1 to 2 years versus just a complete bust?
David E. I. Pyott
Can I take the first part, Jamie? Very calmly, in the past, we\'ve said we\'d give you the conclusion of our decision, and originally we said we would do that on the next summer call. And because we had data available, we completed the obligation early. We are also very clear that we would not give you insight into the clinical data itself because as is always the policy at Allergan, that is reserved for major medical meeting and that will be the AAO in November. So if I could then pass back the second part to Scott, please.
Scott M. Whitcup
So I\'ll just echo what David said and emphasize as well that we don\'t even have all of the analysis back yet. Again, it was based on the initial analysis. We do see that this product looks different than LUCENTIS and enough scientifically to warrant additional Phase II. But our decisions on study design and progressing programs are always very databased. We have enough data that we want to do more Phase II work. And you\'ll see the entire data set, which includes some data that we don\'t even have yet today, at the AAO.
Operator
Our next question is from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.
Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division
I guess I\'ll skip the DARPin questions and maybe go to the bimatoprost update. Just in terms of the bimatoprost update, that push to -- I guess, did you see signals of efficacy that warrant, again, the continuation to push to that -- to the tenfold dose?
David E. I. Pyott
Scott, you\'re on full duty today.
Scott M. Whitcup
So great question, and I\'ll give a little bit of background. So we had enough toxicology to get into the clinic at a dose similar to what was used topically. And so clearly, we wanted to get into the clinic as soon as possible, a, to see if there was a signal of efficacy. And then, two, should we have sufficient data that the efficacy was greater than generic minoxidil because our bar is high, we don\'t want to meet to a generic product then we would have jumped to Phase III. We did see a positive signal for hair growth. That\'s why we\'re going to do the additional Phase II work. And we knew ahead of time, as I had said previously, that we had the ability to grow substantially higher. So our new trials, we\'ll look at a dose approximately tenfold higher than we looked at previously in the same formulation. And we also have a novel formulation that may increase tissue exposure even a little bit higher than that. So just to summarize, you\'re correct. We did see some hair growth. So that there was a signal that it was growing hair but not to the sufficient amount that would warrant going into Phase III with the dose that we previously studied.
Operator
Our next question is from Annabel Samimy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
I want to go back to DARPin for a little bit. With a 1- to 2-year delay, can you give us a sense of how you see the market evolving over the next few years? And would you need to possibly re-prioritize your development of the DARPin PDGF combo, anything you can do to accelerate it? Or is DARPin really the gating factor here?
David E. I. Pyott
Maybe I\'ll take that one. Clearly, when one looks at the scale of the retina market and given that we are an ophthalmology company and not an oncology company, this is right in the center of our strategic endeavors. So as Scott has pointed out, Phase III on the single DARPin alone is enormously expensive. Hence, why we\'re being cautious and considered to make sure that when we go in with Phase III, as Scott said, we have exactly everything worked out for the maximum probability of success. Moving onto the second part of your question on the dual DARPin, really, these 2 are separate programs. And this now delay for the single DARPin should have little to no impact on the dual DARPin moving into the clinic in 2014. Scott, anything you\'d like to add?
Scott M. Whitcup
No, I\'ll just echo that. They\'re separate. We see sufficient differentiation that we wouldn\'t re-prioritize. The dual DARPin is going full-speed ahead given that, that has some additional benefits and could become ultimate standard of care. So at this place in time, we don\'t see an impact from the single DARPin anti-VEGF to the combined VEGF PDGF product.
Operator
Our next question is from Shibani Malhotra, RBC Capital.
Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
A question for David. Really, David, you\'ve always talked about your commitment to the 5-year growth rates for Allergan, 15%, I think you\'d said, earnings growth at least in the mid-year.  Given you had to set back both these expectations of products since you talked about last year at your R&D day. How should we think about your commitment to this growth and are you going to have to look elsewhere to drive this? Or are you still confident that you can grow Allergan organically from a revenue and earnings standpoint?
David E. I. Pyott
Well, obviously, what\'s behind that question, as I interpret it, is you see relative to the perfect best case or a base case of timing on DARPin and Bimatoprost Scalp hair growth. You\'re asking what this the other business, the products that we have approved, really give us in the next couple of years. So as you know, we conduct here at Allergan a 5-year strategic plan. So every year, we roll that. And of course, based on the enormous number of products we\'ve already had approved, if we just speak of FDA, \'09, since the beginning of 2010, and we still have another 3 on tap for the remainder of 2013, we believe that this is sufficient for our strategic plan to be able to produce that kind of mid-teens earnings per share growth that we have spoken about. And there\'s sort of another part you really asked was, what about external growth. Well, as you know, as a company, we generate last year $1.5 billion in cash flow. So we\'re always looking to supplement our internal sources of growth with external and not because of a sense of weakness, but, of course, to the degree we make smart acquisitions or in-license products well. That just increases our probability of success and our ability to grow at the rates I just expounded.
Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
And just to clarify, would you still stay as confident on R&D -- internal R&D capabilities...
David E. I. Pyott
I can\'t hear you, Shibani.
Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Sorry, the question was are you still as confident? I just want to clarify that you\'re still as confident on R&D -- Allergan\'s R&D capabilities internally as you were last year?
David E. I. Pyott
Nothing has changed. I think if you listen to Scott Whitcup, when we move forward, it\'s on a very considered and data-driven basis.

Our next question is  from Greg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
David, I was hoping you could maybe give us a little more color on the BOTOX strength that we saw. You pointed to some growth drivers, both on the therapeutic and the cosmetic sides. Maybe you could give us a little bit more, short of giving us the break it out between the 2, but I wanted to see if you\'d picked a favorite.
David E. I. Pyott
Well, I certainly remarked that the both the franchises grew double digit. I think, for all of you analyzing Allergan\'s performance from the outside, clearly, chronic migraine is a big driver. That one\'s going really well. Recently, when I spent a lot of time at the American Academy of Neurology, I was asking their physicians on their impressions. This wasn\'t a data controlled study. But just to say, "Look, when you have patients, how satisfied are you and how satisfied do you believe your patients are?" And we were getting very, very good numbers. People saying probably close to 80% satisfaction rates, which is extremely high for any drug. Second driver, of course, is urology now coming up rapidly. And then thirdly, I think I alluded to various sort of data points saying the aesthetic markets are healthy. And right now, Allergan\'s even picking up some market share, given that we\'re in a very strong position and maybe our competitors are in a less strong position.

Our next question is from Douglas Tsao with Barclays.
Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division
I think this is for Scott in terms of the DARPin program. I was just hoping you could provide a little bit more color because I think some people are confused in terms of the scope with the additional work that\'s going to you be done in Phase II. Is this sort of revisiting the dosing levels that are going to be tested?
David E. I. Pyott
Scott, if you\'d take that one, please?
Scott M. Whitcup
Sure. So again, all the analysis aren\'t out, so I can\'t really comment on exactly what the additional Phase II work will be until we get all those analysis back. It was just clear that we saw enough product differentiation to do additional Phase II work, but it was clear that there was not enough that we could feel confident on exactly what the Phase III study design could be. So we need that additional work prior to making those decisions.

Our next question is from David Buck with Buckingham Research Group.
David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
I\'ll ask a non-DARPin one. If I could ask this for David and Jeff, maybe. If we look at the 2 acquisitions you made, both the SkinMedica, which was obviously existing sales and products, and also LEVADEX, can you talk about the outlook for sales and earnings contribution \'13, \'14? In other words, how much -- we know the math dilution, I guess, is now about $0.06 to $0.07. What\'s the burden that you\'re expecting with the pushback in LEVADEX and will SkinMedica start to add to growth into \'14? And maybe the revenue base for both.
David E. I. Pyott
Yes, well, I\'ll take the SkinMedica one, that\'s the simplest, where we said this one would become accretive pretty quickly. Because the company, when it was independent, was just about to move into positive earnings territory on its own. And then, of course, us combining our historical business, VIVIT\xc3\x89 and M.D. FORT\xc3\x89, even more importantly, LATISSE with it, gave it quite a boost. In terms of LEVADEX, indeed, the number that we gave you earlier in the year as expected dilution for the MAP acquisition was $0.07. That number remains pretty good. And obviously with -- hopefully, it\'s a 6-month delay. I can say that we\'re very shortly going to be running a validation batch of the finished product per their requirements that we understand from FDA for CMC. And indeed, we agree with those requirements. Had we owned both MAP and Exemplar a year ago, we would have done it exactly the way FDA has, in fact, laid out. So rolling through all that, one hopes -- we hope that we will get the product approved by year end. And obviously then, that pushes some dilution into 2014 because we have roughly a 6-month delay. And it\'s not all bad news because, of course, a singular concentration on getting BOTOX chronic migraine up to adoption rates that we like has a great positive part to it. And then feathering in the LEVADEX detailing at the right time, we\'re looking forward to that. But sometimes, it\'s not all downside. There is some benefit on the BOTOX side of the house. So net-net, I think everything we know is feedback from physicians as they are very interested in LEVADEX. It will be the perfect payer in terms of the detailing point, same call point. And strategically for SkinMedica, everything I\'ve learned about that business since acquisition would point to that it\'s an excellent fit. And we have some great opportunity not only in the United States, but also x U.S. where only about less than 10% of their sales were made.

Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
David, when you answered Shibani\'s question earlier, you talked about the mid-teens EPS growth aspiration. In light of the recent developments, can you also talk about the sustainability over the next couple of years for the 10% top line growth aspiration you disclosed earlier this year? And Scott, why no female patients in next stage of the bimatoprost for scalp? I think you only mentioned male patients.
David E. I. Pyott
Well, obviously, I kind of answered the question in terms of maintaining our mid-teens earnings per share growth outlook. Given really that both Bimatoprost Scalp hair growth and DARPin were outside the time frame of our 5-year strategic plan, then you\'ll understand, I think, immediately why I\'m saying really not much has changed for the 5-year strat plan. You can start going further out. And of course, the further any company goes out, the more cloudy and the more difficult it is to forecast. So for the strat plan period, we still feel good about our 10%-ish. Now obviously, I\'m talking local currency because we have absolutely no control over what relative rates of exchange are from euros or real or yen or whatever currency you like relative to the U.S. dollar. And let me reiterate that in our strategic planning process, we never put in any acquisition fantasies. Until something is owned by Allergan, it does not go into our strategic plan. And so we model it in a way just the same way as you do, as sell-side analysts on the outside.
David E. I. Pyott
Okay, Scott on hair growth.
Scott M. Whitcup
So Larry, the regulatory path, the ease of interpretation of data and the signal were just all easier to put together for males. As we\'re now substantially increasing the dose, it makes sense for us to focus on where the data were clearest and where the pathway is the most well-defined. Based on those data, we\'ll reexplore the female side as well.

Our next question is from Ken Cacciatore with Cowen and Company.
Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
Sorry to go back to DARPin, just a little bit of still confusion on the description here. We have enough data to know it\'s differentiated but we don\'t have enough now yet to know to what extent, and we don\'t have enough data to exactly know what to do in the next stage of development? Or the next stage of development is ongoing and you\'re just not telling us? And I guess, it goes back to the kind of dosing questions or a little bit more specificity about what that next stage is? Or do we simply -- we really have no idea until you collect all the data, what that next stage will be and then maybe timing of when we would see the results of that next stage?
David E. I. Pyott
Scott, those are for you.
Scott M. Whitcup
So we\'ll have some analysis over the next week or 2. Our plan will be to finalize the next part of the Phase II very quickly because I want to be in the clinic as early in Q3 as I can. So we have enough data to know what additional questions we want to answer and what -- roughly what that Phase II looks like. But we\'ll finalize it over the next couple of weeks. The data from Stage 1 and Stage 2, I\'ll be at the AAO. These data, from this additional Phase II work, probably end of next year would be my guess, but it depends how we finalize what exactly that next stage will be.

Our next question is from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.
Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company
Just one clarification on your 2013 guidance. The obesity product and revenues associated with that, was that in your guidance previously and now it\'s out of your guidance? I just wanted to see if you kind of you\'re ways below your total revenue guidance despite taking out your obesity revenue.
Jeffrey L. Edwards
No, Steve, the guidance never included our health business or obesity business. So it was excluded from the guidance at the beginning of time and continues to be excluded and is viewed as a discontinued op at this point.

Our next question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
So my question is on PDGF. I just wanted to understand when you expect that to enter Phase I. And then assuming that you get good data from the Phase I trials, should we expect Phase II to start a year or 2 after the Phase I trial starts?
David E. I. Pyott
Scott, for you.
Scott M. Whitcup
So currently, the plan is that we\'ll file the IND for this, as David said, end of -- approximately end of 2014. It\'s a dual DARPin molecule that blocks both VEGF and anti-PDGF. In ophthalmology, since you\'re giving intraocular injections, in fact, this phase -- these initial studies aren\'t obviously in normal volunteers. They\'re in patients with the disease although, oftentimes, more severe and resistant disease. But even with your initial trials, you get some early signals of efficacy. They tend to be dose escalation on controlled studies. The plan would be as soon as that\'s completed, we\'d go into an additional Phase II. So the initial study tends to be I/II. And probably within a year, you\'d be into your initial true Phase II study.

Our next question is from Andrew Finkelstein with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
Maybe we can talk a little bit about the existing business, particularly in aesthetic, what you\'re seeing with some new competition in the market and how the competitive dynamics are playing out. Are you seeing any changes in discounting behavior and any color on how your programs you think are positioning you at this point?
David E. I. Pyott
Well, let\'s take it one by one. If I look at the neuromodulator market, I think we\'re in a very sound position. As I stated in the U.S., we estimate that market growth is upper single-digits. Then, in terms of market share, very good position, Xeomin is coming up slower than it did in the past. I think Dysport is dipping a little bit on the other side. So obviously, where these 2 competitors versus 1, one would only expect some share loss. But so far, quite moderate. On the dermal filler side, again, good market growth not only in the U.S., but worldwide. And even right now, we\'re picking up share across the world. And hopefully, once we get VOLUMA approved in the United States, there will be, in my view, a further major step-up in growth of market and then, secondly, a share gain for Allergan. And that\'s really been played out everywhere else in the world, whether it be Europe or Latin America or Asia, where that dynamic has occurred. Also, a couple of quick words on Europe, given concerns one might have, when we look at both x factory and also some syndicated market data we have, market conditions remain really good right across the spectrum of neuromodulators for aesthetic-use fillers, as well as breast implants.

Our next question is from David Steinberg with Deutsche Bank.
David M. Steinberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
RESTASIS continues to exceed expectations and I think you mentioned very strong 10% volume growth, and that DTC is playing a big role. I\'m just curious, is it just greater effectiveness of DTC and greater magnitude pulling the patients in or is there something else going on? And then a related question, your patent expires in RESTASIS next year. You\'ve been pretty consistently clear that the hurdles for generic would be very difficult. I was just curious on your view of the branded competitive landscape. Do you expect any products on the market in the next several years? I think the SARcode Bioscience has a Phase III drug. And if this or any products get approved, how do you think it will impact your business?
David E. I. Pyott
Yes, well, first of all, on the market side, and then maybe I\'ll pass it over to Scott for his commentary on branded competition out on the horizon. I think there\'s really kind of 3 motors behind the RESTASIS. One is an ever-growing acceptance that you should treat therapeutic dry eye conditions earlier, and that really has progressed year after year after year. And also, persistence gets better and better because, of course, we have access to data of what is the pack volume, if you like, behind every filled prescription. So that\'s kind of motor 1. Motor 2 is very, very strong growth in optometry. And of course, roughly, there are 3x more optometrists than there are ophthalmologists, so more places for the product to be prescribed. And then, thirdly, DTC, where we have some pretty good models now and we\'ve even increased our investment on the DTC side because we believe we can see a real return on investment, up investment increase to sales and volume. So a very, very good place to be. Obviously, at some point, there will be a competitor. You don\'t normally remain the one and only forever. And so Scott, maybe you could make a few sort of very high-level comments about branded competition?
Scott M. Whitcup
Sure. So first, if someone wanted to come in with another cyclosporine, as David commented, to get an ABE-rated generic would be very difficult just to the study design. It would need to be equivalent to RESTASIS and be a vehicle similar to the same degree that RESTASIS did in its pivotal studies. That\'s a very tough bar, both from the sample side and execution side. In addition for other dry eye products with different mechanisms of action, it\'s very difficult to get those products approved as well just because dry eye is variable, the control is actually artificial tears. And so you have a high control rate. That said, as David pointed out, eventually you might expect another product to be approved. It would probably have different efficacy and kinetics and use than RESTASIS might be complimentary. The disease burden is so great that at some point greater focus will help grow the market, and so difficult to predict exactly when that occurs given it\'s a high hurdle rate. But as David said, eventually, given that this is a very common disease, you would expect additional products. But the bar remains high to get any of them approved.

Our next question is from David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray.
David Amsellem - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
Just a quick question on another ophthalmic pipeline product. This is OZURDEX in DME. And I guess, it may take on more importance given the DARPin setback. But maybe can you give us an update on when we should expect the Phase III for OZURDEX in DME and maybe some color on how you size up the DME market opportunity?
David E. I. Pyott
Okay, Scott, if you want to handle the clinical question, please?
Scott M. Whitcup
Sure. So on OZURDEX, we\'ve stated that Phase III are completed. Our plan is to file the NDA in the U.S. and documents in Europe as well. And the current plan is that the Phase III DME data will be presented at the AAO.
David E. I. Pyott
I think on the market side, it\'s very clear that the use of steroids is much better accepted since the launch of OZURDEX and also some other products by competition. And in terms of pursuant to the approval of OZURDEX for retinal vein occlusion and uveitis and, clearly, when one looks at DME, this is the largest of the potential application areas. And we\'re actually very excited about this, assuming that we can secure approval both in the United States and Europe.

Our next question is from Louise Chen with Guggenheim.
Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division
So just back on DARPin one more time. I was curious, in your opinion, what is the most important factor that determines the longevity of a product? Is it binding affinity, half-life or molecular weight? And then as you move through your third Phase II study, is there any chance you would additionally reformulate the product or change the trial design?
David E. I. Pyott
Scott, that one is for you.
Scott M. Whitcup
So Louise, it\'s a great question. Our assessment in terms of half-life, it\'s binding affinity, it\'s half-life. It\'s also size because that will influence how much of the drug you can actually inject into the eye. And all of those will potentially play a role in duration. Our goal in the Phase II program is eventually to have a design that mimics the Phase III. It\'s the learn and confirm. So based on the analysis that we\'re doing from the second stage of the Phase II will help us get this next piece of the Phase II, which should be very similar to what we plan to take into Phase III.

Our final question is from Tim Lugo with William Blair.
Tim Lugo - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
Can you just update us on BOTOX therapeutics trends, maybe x U.S.? I know a couple of quarters ago, you mentioned that Europe was a little slower than expected.
David E. I. Pyott
Well, I think, clearly, I\'m signaling to very strong growth in the United States in therapeutic, thanks to the uptake in chronic migraine, thanks to the urology indications and also continued some growth in the traditional movement disorder areas. If we look at Western Europe, I would say our best guess, because, of course, it\'s very hard to triangulate all the market factors, I would think that market is growing somewhere around mid-single digits. And right now, we\'re even fractionally picking up market share due to the new indications and also better performance on our core traditional movement disorder indications.
