Paul M. Bisaro
Taking a look at this morning\xe2\x80\x99s earnings report, we are pleased to announce that our second quarter finished in line with our expectations. We posted GAAP earnings of $0.53 and adjusted earnings of $0.48 per share. On an adjusted basis, the second quarter EPS increased 40% over last year. 
While this increase is primarily attributable to the significant decline in amortization related to Ferrlecit, the Brand division did lead the quarter with strong product sales, surpassing $100.0 million for the first time in recent years. 
Mark will be going into more detail on the financial results in a few moments. But first, there are a number of events and accomplishments during the second quarter that I would like to highlight.
Turning first to our generics business, the Generic business continues to be enhanced by the progress we are making, both operationally in Generic and in Generic R&D. As anticipated, and as forecast, with the successful resolution of OAI at our Davie, Florida, site in April, we are gaining approvals and launching products out of that site. 
We first saw approvals for Omeprazole 40 mg and then Potassium Chloride. Omeprazole 40 mg was launched in July and we anticipate launching Potassium Chloride later this month. We anticipate additional approvals out of the site and will launch these products in due course as we complete validation work and prepare launch quantities.
In our oral contraceptive business it remains strong and we saw a normalization of our OC sales in the second quarter following a shift in our customer base in the first quarter. Also, because of recent heavy promotion or newer, branded OCs, we are seeing some prescription shift from the older OCs to the newer brands and as a result, seeing a slight decline in units in our older, generic OCs.
On the cost side we continue to make progress on our global supply chain initiative. Product transfers from our Carmel, New York, to our Florida, California, and India sites continue and we are meeting or exceeding all of our internal milestones. 
And with the Davie, Florida, site now cleared for new production, the products being launched from that site not only will provide us with important sources of new revenue but will also leverage our manufacturing capacity at that facility.
Our generic pipeline continues to develop as well. We currently have approximately 60 ANDAs pending, a significant number of these ANDAs are for products that are either first-to-file or have some form of differentiation. And I would also point out that this pipeline includes about a dozen new oral contraceptive opportunities.
Moving now to the brand side of the business, as I said earlier, we achieved $100.0 million in product sales for the first time in three years. This is primarily due to higher sales of TRELSTAR and some strong work by our sales team. 
We also had a significant presence at the AUA Conference in May in Florida. Both oxybutynin topical gel and silodosin were well received in data presentations. Silodosin, our novel, alpha one-A blocker, under development for BPH was featured in an oral presentation highlighting the strengths of its cardiac profile. Data presented at AUA showed that silodosin did not demonstrate any meaningful effect on heart rate or QTC interval duration. As you may know, the FDA is recommending that new drugs under development, particularly agents with systemic viability undergo critical assessment of their effect on QTC interval.
Also during the quarter our new drug application for oxybutynin topical gel for overactive bladder was accepted by the agency for filing. Under PADUFA we anticipate the FDA will respond to our application on or about January 27, 2009. 
Data surrounding the oxybutynin topical gel and silodosin will continue to be presented and published over the coming months. The silodosin pivotal Phase 3 data and the one-year open-label data have been accepted for podium presentations at the AUA New England Sectional Meeting scheduled for September 25-September 27.
The new drug application for silodosin remains on track at the agency. Under the new FDA guidelines we anticipate that we will receive a complete response letter on our PADUFA date of October 13, 2008.
Silodosin and oxybutynin topical gel will be the first of many new products that Watson will be unveiling over the coming years. While we don\xe2\x80\x99t know when the FDA will ultimately approve our applications, we are confident we have submitted all of the appropriate data and have strong applications pending. Assuming everything stays on track, the brand division is actively planning for two product launches in 2009. It is possible that we could get two approvals in a short time span. Should that be the case, we are planning to launch the oxybutynin topical gel first, followed by the silodosin.
Turning now to TRELSTAR, in June we successfully launched a new delivery system for TRELSTAR called MIXJECT. MIXJECT offers physicians and nurses new features that make preparation, administration, and disposal easier and offers patients greater comfort through a thinner needle. We are getting favorable feedback from the physician community on these new enhancements and we anticipate TRELSTAR sales will continue to be strong. 
In addition, we continue to make progress on the development of the six-month formulation of TRELSTAR. We remain on target to have our third NDA for 2008 on file with the agency in the fourth quarter.
Within our Nephrology franchise our discussions with Sanofi continue as we look to extend our distribution agreement for Ferrlecit beyond 2009. We remain hopeful that these negotiations will be successful, however we can\xe2\x80\x99t offer any guarantees at this time. And we continue to work on contingency plans should the deal with Sanofi not be achieved.
Turning now to our Distribution business, we are pleased with the improvements we are seeing in the Distribution division\xe2\x80\x99s gross margins, as we saw sequential margin improvement from 15.2% to 15.7%. ANDA has several initiatives underway to enhance its margins and we are starting to see the results of these initiatives. We expect to maintain these margins at these levels going forward.
On a relative basis, Distribution revenues were slightly lower compared to recent quarters where there were significant product launches. The second quarter saw a low number of new product launches which accounted for the decrease in year-over-year revenues. However, in July ANDA had some very successful launches and we anticipate revenues to rebound off the second quarter levels and of course, these launches will be recognized during our third quarter.
So, as you can see, we continue to execute on the strategic objectives we set out for ourselves at the beginning of the year. And these were: one, to revolve the OAI at Davie and initiate product launches from that site; two, file three NDAs with the agency, we filed two and are on track to file the third; three, to meet our global supply chain objectives, which include manufacturing capacity expansion in our Goa, India, site and product transfers at our U.S. sites; and four, expand and differentiate our Generic product portfolio. This has included a re-prioritization of our Generic R&D program, the restructuring of our Generic R&D organization and the filling of some key leadership positions. 
As we pass the mid-year point, I am very pleased with the progress we have made on these initiatives. I believe the second half of 2008 will see continued progress on these initiatives as we prepare for a very exciting 2009.
In addition to this internal effort, we have also been very active on the business development front, evaluating new opportunities for all of our businesses. Within Brands we have been looking to expand our product-development pipeline in urology, nephrology, and gynecology. In Generics we continue to evaluate opportunities to expand sales and marketing capabilities globally. And on the biologics front we continue to look for opportunities to participate in the bio-generic space.
We will be opportunistic and we will move when the right transaction presents it, but we will also remain mindful of managing our balance sheet appropriately.
With that I will have the call over to Mark who will give you some more details on our financial results for the quarter.
Mark W. Durand
I would like to now provide highlights of our second quarter financial results on a consolidated and divisional basis, as well as provide you with our expectations for the remainder of the year.
Second quarter of 2008, net revenue was $623.0 million, consisting of $377.0 million from Generics, $118.0 million from the Brand division, and $128.0 million from ANDA. Net revenue is up 3% from $603.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2007.
Gross profit for the quarter also increased to $263.0 million, up from $243.0 million during the second quarter of 2007.
Our consolidated gross margin increased by 2% to 42.2% in the second quarter. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to product mix and growth and the other revenue within our Generic and Brand divisions.
Now to our divisional performance: Generic second quarter net revenue was $377.0 million, consisting of $344.0 million in product sales and $32.0 million in other revenue. Compared to the second quarter of 2007 Generic revenue increased by $31.0 million, or 9% and is also up sequentially from the first quarter revenue of $367.0 million. Generic other revenue includes $15.0 million related to a sales milestone payment we received from Barr, related to a legal settlement on sandostatin. The increase in Generic total revenue year-over-year is also due to new product launches, including bupropion XL 300 mg, alendronate, and transdermal fentanyl.
Oral contraceptive sales in the second quarter were $87.0 million, in line with our expectations. This is a 13% improvement, from $78.0 million in the first quarter in which we had a shift in our customer base and is down slightly from $91.0 million last year.
Other revenue increased $14.0 million from the prior year period and reflects the previously mentioned milestone payment. 
Generic gross profit was $149.0 million in the second quarter, excluding the milestone payment, and approximately $4.5 million in global supply chain costs. Gross profit was $139.0 million, or 38% of revenue in the second quarter, up from $137.0 million in the first quarter of 2008.
Moving on to the Brand division, net revenue was $118.0 million. This is an increase from $111.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2007 and $115.0 million reported in the first quarter of this year. 
Brand product sales increased 5% to $101.0 million, with specialty product sales at $58.0 million and nephrology sales at $43.0 million. The current quarter\xe2\x80\x99s strong product sales reflect solid year-over-year growth to Trelstar.
Other brand revenue was $17.0 million, up 20% from $14.0 million last year, related to various licensing arrangements.
Brand gross margin in the second quarter was 79.3%, up 3.5% on a year-to-year basis. The increase in Brand gross margin primarily reflects the increase in other revenue and a higher contribution from certain specialty products, including Trelstar.
Finally, net revenue from the Anda division was $128.0 million, down 13% from prior year due to several new product launches last year that were not replaced during the recent quarter and also due to price erosion in the segment. As a reminder, second quarter Anda sales do not reflect revenue from the third quarter launches of generic risperdal and generic fluorouracil.
Distribution gross margin was 15.7%, up from 15.2% during the first quarter of 2008 and down slightly from 15.9% in the prior year period, as a result of recent initiatives to enhance efficiencies in the business.
Turning now to our operating expenses, R&D spending for the second quarter was $39.0 million, which is up about 10% compared to the prior year period.
SG&A for the quarter was $104.0 million, an increase of $7.0 million from the prior year quarter due primarily to higher spending in anticipation of our 2009 Brand product launches.
Amortization for the second quarter was $20.0 million, a decrease of $24.0 million from the second quarter last year, reflecting the full amortization of Ferrlecit product rights. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.48 per share and excludes the $15.0 million milestone payment and $5.4 million in costs associated with our global supply chain initiative. Adjusted EPS is up $0.14 over last year, nearly all of which is due to the change in amortization expense.
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.53 per share. Details on the adjustments can be found in the reconciliation table in our press release.
Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $137.0 million, essentially even with the prior year.
Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $100.0 million, in increase from first quarter level of $67.0 million.
And cap-ex for the second quarter decreased from both prior year quarter and first quarter to approximately $11.0 million.
At the end of the second quarter cash and marketable securities were $278.0 million and our long-term debt remained at approximately $825.0 million and our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 30%.
I would now like to revisit our outlook for the remainder of 2008. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to be approximately $2.5 billion. Given the results of the first half of 2008 and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we are adjusting our revenues for the business segments. 
We now expect Generic revenues to be between $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, as compared to the previous range of $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion. Generic price erosion is expected to remain at about 10% for the year and based on overall prescription trends oral contraceptive sales will be between $80.0 million to $85.0 million for both Q3 and Q4. 
We anticipate exceeding our prior estimates for the Brand segment net revenues and now forecast between $450.0 million to $470.0 million for the year, an increase from the previous forecast of $420.0 million to $440.0 million.
There has been no change to our Anda Distribution revenue estimates of between $580.0 million to $610.0 million.
We expect R&D spending to remain at approximately $160.0 million with about 2/3 going towards Generics and 1/3 to Brand programs.
SG&A expenses are expected to be between $420.0 million to $440.0 million reflecting slightly higher marketing spend in anticipation of the Oxybutynin Topical Gel and solidosin product launches.
Amortization expense for 2008 continues to be expected to be approximately $80.0 million.
For 2008 we expect both adjusted and GAAP earnings to be between $1.90 to $2.00. Adjusted earnings remain unchanged. GAAP EPS estimates have been revised upwards to reflect the sales milestone from Barr, the resolution of an Internal Revenue Service audit, and the divestiture of our interest in Somerset Pharmaceutical\xe2\x80\x99s joint venture. 
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $551.0 million to $571.0 million with capital expenditures anticipated to be close to $80.0 million for the year.
Cash flow from operations are expected to remain strong.
Let me turn the call back to Paul for some concluding remarks.
Paul M. Bisaro
As you can see, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some small adjustments to our forecast based on the first half actuals, but all in all we\xe2\x80\x99re very comfortable with our estimates for the remainder of 2008. And all I would add is, as a reminder, we do not include revenue from any patent challenges nor do we have any revenue included for the potential launch of generic Lovenox in our 2008 estimates.
With that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it back to Patty to open it up for questions.
Patty Eisenhaur
We will now open the call up for questions and answers.
\n', b'
Operator
(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Rich Silver - Lehman Brothers.
Rich Silver \xe2\x80\x93 Lehman Brothers
Maybe you could elaborate a little bit on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the OCs. You mentioned you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing some movement from generic to new brands. Just to talk a little bit more about that.
And also the OCs that you said, the 12 new OCs that you have filed, can you give us some sense of the timing there? Maybe when you have filed those and when you expect those to be approved? And how meaningful those would be relative to your current portfolio? 
And just generally speaking, what kind of growth outlook you are assuming on a longer-term basis for the OC business.
Paul M. Bisaro
Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99ll focus on OCs. The first part of the question I think was on changes and unit trends. This is really no different that what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over time and as companies start DTC campaigns, as they start pushing new, branded oral contraceptives in the physicians\xe2\x80\x99 office, we do see from time to time unit trends move from the older OCs to those newer brand products.
For our second half of the year, I guess we see a little bit of a unit decline in one product in particular where the unit trends seem to have dropped pretty precipitously as, I think detailing has moved from that product to other products and so while we were expecting perhaps more revenue from that product. [audio feedback]
As the trends going forward, I mentioned that we have 12 OCs pending, we\xe2\x80\x99ve filed those over time. Some of them you know about. We have YAz and Yasmine, some of the first-to-file product opportunities that are pending, and I expect those products to come out in due course as we work through the litigation around them. And I think they will be meaningful for our oral contraceptive franchise.
I think the important point to remember here is there will be, as always, a lot noise around the oral contraceptive franchise, is that we have 24 products today, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to probably have 34 products by 2010 and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to remain a strong franchise for us going forward. And we believe we can compete in that franchise against anyone going forward. So we see oral contraceptives to be an important part of our product line for a long period of time and an important contributor to Watson\xe2\x80\x99s profitability in the future.
Rich Silver \xe2\x80\x93 Lehman Brothers
And one more question, Paul. Do you have any thoughts on today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement by Mylan and not only specific to the Mylan announcement, but just generally speaking, whether your expectation over the next two years would be for this to be a more competitive market, beyond the players that you\xe2\x80\x99re familiar with, such as Sandoz as a potential competitor?
Paul M. Bisaro
I don\xe2\x80\x99t see much, I guess none of this really surprises us very much. We were aware of  Famy Care, of course. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure everyone, almost everyone was, who participates in the oral contraceptive market. The fact that they\xe2\x80\x99ve partnered with Mylan is fine. Mylan is a good competitor, we\xe2\x80\x99ll compete with them when they come with the products.
I think the franchise still will remain strong. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see ten companies doing oral contraceptives. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see the big companies doing them because that\xe2\x80\x99s part of their overall portfolio plan.
But again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re in a great position to compete. I am not troubled by it. I also don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to occur in 2008; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think even in early 2009. We probably have a little bit more time there, as well. But we do anticipate Sandoz will be there and now we know Mylan will be coming and Teva, of course, now will be part of, will take the Barr portfolios. So I don\xe2\x80\x99t see much of a change in that.
Rich Silver \xe2\x80\x93 Lehman Brothers
But with all of that you still expect this to be a source of growth for Watson?
Paul M. Bisaro
Yes, I do, Rich, because of the first-to-file opportunities that exist. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a number of them pending, as you know, and those always drive growth. So I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see our franchise remain strong.
Operator
Your next question comes from Greg Gilbert - Merrill Lynch.
Gregory Gilbert - Merrill Lynch 
Paul, you touched on the discussions with Sanofi. Are they focused at this point only on the extension part of the deal or is there still a debate about the original duration of the deal?
Paul M. Bisaro
Well, you know, in any negotiation, Greg, there are ebbs and flows and of course, they have a position and we have a position. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, we believe and as we\xe2\x80\x99ve disclosed in our 10-K, we\xe2\x80\x99ve even disclosed the text of the dispute. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that we have the products for 2009 and if we have to we will arbitrate that. But I\xe2\x80\x99m hopeful that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to get a resolution that works for Sanofi and works for us.
Gregory Gilbert - Merrill Lynch 
On Lovenox you mentioned it\xe2\x80\x99s not in guidance. Can you give us your latest update from your partner on what the rate-limiting steps are? We know that Momenta and I believe Teva Plan 2 provide additional immunogenicity data in the third quarter. Is there any granularity you can provide regarding your partner\xe2\x80\x99s status?
Paul M. Bisaro
Well, our partner, which is Amphastar, handles all the negotiations and the discussions with the FDA and we are not part of those discussions. We are simply a marketing partner, as I said in the past. From what I can tell, they seem very hopeful that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to get the product. So we are in a wait-and-see mode right now and I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have much more to add than that.
Gregory Gilbert - Merrill Lynch 
I have a question on distribution. Clearly some of those launches got pushed into the next quarter, not pushed, but are going to come in the next quarter. Is there any evidence that some of your larger competitors are making inroads in what your core audience is? Do you believe your market share has been relatively stable?
Albert Paonessa III
Market share as to customers, yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re stable. Actually, my independent customer base, I was just looking at it, is up for the first half of this year, including July. So our presence in new product launches is still very strong.
Gregory Gilbert - Merrill Lynch 
And one last one for Paul, a bigger question. Can you offer any observations on what seems to be a heightened pace of generic M&A and how that affects your view of Watson as a buyer and/or a seller over time?
Paul M. Bisaro
There certainly was some activity in the mergers and acquisitions front in the last month or so. But I would say, from Watson\xe2\x80\x99 perspective, we are a buyer. We\xe2\x80\x99re looking to expand our footprint, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, repeatedly. We need to find the right opportunity to do that. And we want to grow our business internationally. We right now don\xe2\x80\x99t have much, if any, international sales and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s something we need to focus on in the coming years. And when the right opportunity presents itself, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take it.
As to being a seller, Watson, we don\xe2\x80\x99t think that way. What we think about is growing the business, growing our earnings and driving value for our shareholders. You can\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee what somebody might do someday but right now we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on growth.
Operator
Your next question comes from Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company.
Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company
Quick question on Actos/Met[formin] XR. If you could give us any sense of timing there and maybe provide some sense around the economics.
And also maybe on silodosin, if you could give us a little bit of sense about what you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking in terms of potential co-promotion and also maybe the profile of this product as it enters the market, any managed-care discussions, where you think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in terms of tiering.
And also on that, if there\xe2\x80\x99s any head-to-head studies that we should be expecting potentially against Flomax or any of the other competitors.
Paul M. Bisaro
Ken, I\xe2\x80\x99ll start with the question about Actos/Metformin. Of course, this product is controlled by Takeda, and I believe their new action date is November 1. Right now, of course, they\xe2\x80\x99re handling the discussions with the agency so we\xe2\x80\x99re not quite certain on that.
As you will recall, we manufacture the product for them. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had some discussions with them. We\xe2\x80\x99re in discussions with them now about what the future will look like for this product and we\xe2\x80\x99re not really at liberty to describe what the results of those discussions are. But this could be an important product for us and we will continue to focus on it and get the product ready for them when they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to launch.
I think you asked about silodosin. I think the silodosin message, as we said in the past, is one of education for the urologist. We are going to focus on our urology team of about 120 reps, educating urologists about the advantages of silodosin, the cardiovascular profile, and why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to be concerned about QTC intervals and those kinds of issues. And we think that that effort will take some time.
We continue to discuss partnering this product for the primary care physicians with other companies. Those discussions continue. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a result yet. We believe we could do a good job with the product on our own but certainly a partner could help us get more reach.
You know, one of the other factors here is the timing of Flomax going off patent. And that product goes off patent in I think early 2010 and we want to be mindful of that as we prepare to launch the product and as we prepare to launch the product particularly into the PCP category. You know, we don\xe2\x80\x99t see a lot of advantage to go out there and try and get beat up by Flomax, which has been the market leader for such a long time, with all the sales reps out there. So it might be smarter for us to sort of plan that timing to when the Flomax detailing starts to go dark. 
So we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously very mindful of that, which is why I said in my prepared remarks about the launch timing of the Oxybutynin Topical Gel, assuming everything stays on track, we will probably launch that product first, followed by the silodosin product. Basically in recognition of the fact of the timing of the Flomax patent expiry. 
Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company
And just a follow-up on Greg\xe2\x80\x99s question, hopefully we don\xe2\x80\x99t push too much here, but you did indicate contingency plans on Ferrlecit. Can you give us any thoughts on what you mean by that or any details on what you mean by that?
Paul M. Bisaro
Actually, without trying to be too flip about it, no. I would rather not go into detail because they\xe2\x80\x99re obviously something that we want to prepare and if we have to use them, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at ways in which we can obviously continue to use our nephrology sales force. And that\xe2\x80\x99s about all I want to say about that.
As I said, very hopeful we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to reach agreement with Sanofi, I think negotiations are progressing and we hope to get them resolved in short order.
Operator
Your next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser - UBS
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS
First of all, the Distribution segment. Obviously you mentioned the products\xe2\x80\x99 introduction is driving the weakness in the quarter, but do you see any kind of like strategic shift in the market as the three large wholesalers are making efforts to penetrate the existing customer base more than historically?
And then secondly, if you can just comment on the pricing environment for the base business in the quarter.
Paul M. Bisaro
I will start with on the distribution side of the business I think it\xe2\x80\x99s clear it\xe2\x80\x99s competitive. As you mentioned, clearly ABC, McCutcheon, and Cardinal are working aggressively to maintain their business and their market share. And Anda is doing the same thing. Anda is working very hard at new ways of penetrating and adding value to its customers. 
And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see, and as I mentioned, in the third quarter sort of a rebound of revenues with the launch of two very successful products. But also some new initiatives that Anda has underway, including looking more at specialty Brand distribution and moving into those kinds of opportunities which traditionally Anda hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done but now we think it makes sense for Anda to consider that and they\xe2\x80\x99re moving in that direction. 
So Anda is working on a lot of new initiatives to help drive its business. Also to maintain it\xe2\x80\x99s current business and market share. And you heard Al say market share, certainly in his independent area still remains strong. So the Distribution business I think is in good shape.
Turning then to, I think you asked about the pricing environment for the Generic market place. I guess we\xe2\x80\x99re still comfortable with the projections we gave about earlier this year about a 10% decline overall in sort of the Generic base business. We don\xe2\x80\x99t see much reason to change that projection. 
Of course, from time to time some products seem, you will see some pricing competition on products as multiple companies enter, but we have a product line of 150 product families and by and large those product families remain relatively strong, or maintain relatively strong.

As just as a reminder, when do you expect products to be launched from the Florida facility?
Paul M. Bisaro
We launched Omeprazole 40 mg in July and we expect to launch our Potassium Chloride later this month. So we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it right now.

Your next question comes from Analyst for Randall Stanicky - Goldman Sachs     
Analyst for Randall Stanicky - Goldman Sachs     
I had a question on the Branded margins seemed really strong in the quarter. I think you said it was churned from the other revenue and strong Trelstar. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on how sustainable this margin was for this business going forward.
And then also, a different topic, if you could provide any update on Concerta. I know last quarter you mentioned that you were expecting approval by year end. I was just wondering if there was any update there.
Mark W. Durand
I would suggest that we look at Brand margins sort of normalizing where we were in the first quarter of the year. You\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely right on the impact on the second quarter and would expect first quarter margins to maintain for the remainder of the year.
I\xe2\x80\x99ll pass on the second part of your question to Paul.
Paul M. Bisaro
On the Concerta I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I said we expect approval by the end of the year, what I think we talked about on Concerta was our litigation had been completed in December of last year and we are awaiting the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision. We\xe2\x80\x99re in post-trial briefing mode right now and that\xe2\x80\x99s moving along. We expect a decision from the Court, hopefully and you can\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee when this is going to happen, but we hope that will happen in short order. Maybe even in 2008. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked the FDA, of course, for approval of our Concerta product which was being held up by the OAI status of Florida.
We\xe2\x80\x99re working with the agency to get tentative approval and then hopefully even final approval as we work through the issues on the pending citizens\xe2\x80\x99 petition.
Analyst for Randall Stanicky - Goldman Sachs     
Has the FDA given you any indication on the first-to-file status, how that would be handled with Concerta?
Paul M. Bisaro
We have not gotten any indication on that. No.

Your next question comes from Marc Goodman - Credit Suisse 
Marc Goodman - Credit Suisse 
Can you talk about your discussions with companies for bio-generics? Are there a lot of opportunities there? Is it just a lot of the companies you\xe2\x80\x99re meeting are not of the right quality? Just how many situations are out there that you think are real that you have a real opportunity there?
And second of all, can you give us an update on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening over at Goa and the capacity and when that whole process of moving products over?
Paul M. Bisaro
On the bio-generics front we have systematically met with every potential, viable company that we could think of. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been all over the world and we continue to go all over the world to meet with these companies. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen about a handful of companies that we think are viable partners for us as we move forward.
Our challenge, frankly, is many of these companies would be extremely dilutive to the company\xe2\x80\x99s earnings in the short term and we have to sort of work our way through those issues. But also finding the most appropriate partner is what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do. 
Again, I would say there\xe2\x80\x99s about a handful of companies that I think have the ability and have demonstrated the ability to be able to do bio-generics. So, those opportunities exist, it\xe2\x80\x99s finding the right one and being able to put it together financially in the right way.
Marc Goodman - Credit Suisse 
So when you say you\xe2\x80\x99ve met many, have you met like 25 and there\xe2\x80\x99s five? I mean just to give us a sense.
Paul M. Bisaro
I would bet we\xe2\x80\x99ve probably talked to at least 30 companies. 
And then the second question was on the Goa capacity. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer it this way, we anticipate receiving from Goa this year about a billion units and the facility is undergoing an expansion right now and we think we\xe2\x80\x99ll do about three billion units next year in that facility.
So overall capacity for the facility could be as much as four to five billion but that\xe2\x80\x99s probably a year or so away, probably two years away. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to move products there so it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a little time so we\xe2\x80\x99ve got time to complete the construction and the work that\xe2\x80\x99s being done. 
We\xe2\x80\x99re real pleased with how that facility is moving along now. It\xe2\x80\x99s shipping products today. Those products are in our facilities and we\xe2\x80\x99re distributing them. So things are going well.
Marc Goodman - Credit Suisse 
One other thing, just on the Paragraph 4 pipeline, can you give us an update on any of your products that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been mentioned so far?
Paul M. Bisaro
Well, I think you probably know most of what\xe2\x80\x99s on the list. I think the one to highlight would be the planned launch in 2009 of the Cardizem LA product in April. That\xe2\x80\x99s a date certain launch for us. And I guess we got suit on Fentora this quarter as well. So that was a new product patent challenge for us. 
And then our overall pipeline. I mentioned rebalancing our pipeline and talked about sort of restructuring that generic pipeline to focus more on Paragraph 4 opportunities. And that hopefully will come to fruition as we start filing sort of the new wave of products at the end of this year and into next year. So hopefully you\xe2\x80\x99ll see, we anticipate at least more Paragraph 4 first-to-file opportunities in the coming years.

Your next question comes from David Buck - Buckingham Research
David Buck - Buckingham Research
Can you give an update on the timing of when you expect your own generic Toprol-XL to be launched? And also generic Lotrel?
And then, Paul, you mentioned obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re in negotiations with Ferrlecid but should we be expecting, at least for 2010, to see a meaningful change in your profitability with Ferrlecid? At the minimum? I guess if you\xe2\x80\x99re successful would you expect that to be the most likely outcome?
And then on global generics, can you talk about, you had mentioned bio-generics managing dilution. When we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen U.S.-based generic companies go global it led to obviously meaningful near-term dilution. I just wanted to hear comments about what you\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to plan for in terms of that, if you do go global near term.
Paul M. Bisaro
Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we start with the Ferrlecid question first. As I mentioned, when we first disclosed, or first discussed, the Ferrlecid situation with Sanofi I said that we do expect a meaningful change in the economics of the transaction, beginning in 2010. And I stay with that. Any new agreement would clearly change the economics of the Ferrlecid. 
And I\xe2\x80\x99ve also said that our Oxybutynin Topical Gel product and the silodosin product, we think are sufficient to not only cover that loss, or change, but exceed it. So we do anticipate being able to handle that issue.
On the bio-generics front and sort of the dilution question, in total I guess I would say that in any kind of major transaction you\xe2\x80\x99re probably going to have some short-term dilution and we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to take that. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say never and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to box myself into anything but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see us doing a transaction that\xe2\x80\x99s so dilutive that it takes years for us to get out it. 
So while short-term dilution is probably acceptable, long-term dilution would not be so we would be looking for an opportunity that we could see some value in the relatively short term.
And then I think the third part of the question was Toprol and when we expect that. We continue to work on approval of all four strengths of our Toprol product and we are working through some issues with the agency on the applications and when those are done we will launch the product. Our agreement with Sandoz is still in place so we continue to see other revenue on that and stay tuned for more, but probably later in the year.
David Buck - Buckingham Research
And one final, the generic Lotrel.
Paul M. Bisaro
I think our case is stayed pending the outcome of the Teva litigation.

Your next question comes from Lei Huang - Summer Street Research
Lei Huang - Summer Street Research
Can you talk about, in the Anda business you mentioned you are looking into the specialty brands as a way to diversify that business. How would that impact the margin in that business?
Paul M. Bisaro
Good question. It could, it could, reduce the margin overall. It would increase revenue but we could see a reduction in margin. But frankly I think we have to focus on the health of the overall business and therefore I think we might have to give up a little bit of margin to deal with that. But it\xe2\x80\x99s really about profitability, not necessarily about margins. So you would probably see a decline in margins if we went heavily into the specialty brand distribution.
Lei Huang - Summer Street Research
Okay, so that fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re expecting second half and the margin to remain kind of at the current level, that would suggest that you\xe2\x80\x99re not getting into the specialty brands, at least not in a material way.
Paul M. Bisaro
In the second half of 2008 that\xe2\x80\x99s probably correct.
Lei Huang - Summer Street Research
And then looking at your Generic business in the second quarter, it looks as if the gross margin was obviously lower. Part of it was just due to a decline in the other Generic revenue, but I think even in Generic product sales the margin was lower. Is there anything to account for that?
Paul M. Bisaro
I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably, it probably was very small reduction in the revenue, in the product revenue, area but what would account for that would have been sort of we had no real major launches in the second quarter and so there was sort of normal margin decline in the second quarter.
Lei Huang - Summer Street Research
And in terms of working to expand that global footprint, you mentioned that the company would be opportunistic in terms of when to do a deal, but is there a timeline we should be looking at over the next 12 months? Next 3 years, next 5 years, in terms of when the company hopes to gain that global footprint?
Paul M. Bisaro
Well, there are companies that are actively working on, that have processes underway, for the sale of those companies and I would anticipate we will participate in those activities. So I think you could see something as soon as 12 months for us. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will take 3 years for us to find the right partner. So probably somewhere in the next 1-2 years. But it really sort of depends on the other party.

Your last question comes from Rodney Dowell - Bernstein
Rodney Dowell - Bernstein
First, about Oxybutynin Topical Gel, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that Alligin going into that market and spending quite significantly with limited success. How do you guys think about yourselves and marketing for Oxybutynin Topical Gel? Would you have to begin to push up your sales and marketing next year in the Branded division?
And second, around Fentora, being first to file, can you share with us if, I remember you guys had a differentiated technology to develop opiates previously. Is that technology being used in that product or essentially is that an attempt to replicate the development by acethelone?
Paul M. Bisaro
Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll focus on the Oxybutynin Topical Gel. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough facts to answer the question about how well the new products are doing, but here\xe2\x80\x99s what we think is going to happen with the Oxybutynin Topical Gel. We think this product is probably the best product in the category because of the way it\xe2\x80\x99s delivered and the results that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the skin irritation tests as well as the efficacy of the product. So we\xe2\x80\x99re very excited about the opportunity this product presents for us. 
We will most likely ramp up spending for this product as we get closer to launch and, yes, you could see us spending more on the Oxybutynin Gel preparation but we also anticipate a quick up take of this product in the market. So some of that spend will be offset, we hope, by the revenues and the profitability we generate from the product.
Regarding Fentora, I would say it\xe2\x80\x99s our ability to develop generic products which is one of the differentiating factors that Watson has over some of our competitors and Fentora is a sentinel buccal delivery technology. We have that technology here, we used our own technology to develop it, but it is, of course, bio-equivalent to the Fentora product. 
So we do have that capability and we will continue to work on products like this that keep us differentiated from other companies.
Rodney Dowell - Bernstein
The reason I\xe2\x80\x99m asking that question about Fentora is trying to assess whether there\xe2\x80\x99s a viable non-infringement argument and it sounds from what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying you potentially have one based on your own technology.
Paul M. Bisaro
Well, most litigations like this have always some element of invalidity and non-infringement and I anticipate that this has the same characteristics.
