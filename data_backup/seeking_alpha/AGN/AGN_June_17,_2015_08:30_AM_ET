Ladies and gentlemen thank your standing by and welcome to the Allergan acquisition of KYTHERA. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen only mode. After the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. 
It is now pleasure to turn the call over to Lisa DeFrancesco to begin. Please go ahead. 
Lisa DeFrancesco
Thank you Maria and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for this brief call to discuss the proposed acquisition of KYTHERA which we announced in the press release issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is available on our website at www.Allergan.com. We will be using a slide presentation during today\'s call to provide an overview with the transaction of benefits and potential timing which is available on the webcast as well as for download on the investor relations section of Allergan.com. 
Joining us on today\'s call are Brent Saunders our CEO and President; Paul Bisaro our Executive Chairman; Tessa Hilado, our Chief Financial Officer; David Nicholson our Executive Vice President of Global Brand Research and Development and Philippe Schaison, President Allergan Medical. I would like to remind you that during the course of this call management will make certain forward looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statements and the important information for investors and shareholders language regarding these statements in the press release issued earlier this morning and on pages 2 and 3 in the slide presentation. Following management\'s review the presentation we will open up the call for questions from the audience. With that I will turn the call over to Brent. 
Brent Saunders 
Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on short notice. This will be a relatively brief call, we do have some slide we\'ll walk through but we\'ll try to do that relatively quickly and then move it to Q&A. And why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just start with the slide 4 if we can. I would also apologize on logistics, David, Philippe and I are in California and the rest of the team is in New Jersey as we\'re going to KYTHERA today to do some town halls and begin the pre-integration planning process as well. 
So on slide 4 you can see some of the basic facts. The most important I think is the strategic logic of this deal is incredibly sound for us, this is really about extending our leadership in facial aesthetics. I\'ll show you a diagram on the next slide in a moment, but their lead product, KYTHERA\'s lead product, KYBELLA for submental fat or double chin as its more commonly know is the perfect complement to our full line of facial aesthetics and we view this as a really exciting opportunity. This drug KYBELLA was approved by the FDA in end of April of this year. It has very good clinical data and a very nice label. We also are looking forward to potential approvals ex-U.S it has been filed in Canada, Switzerland and Australia and we\'ll continue to pursue additional markets around the world. 
This really does as I mentioned earlier broaden our leadership position in facial aesthetics and aesthetics in general. And we also add I think a very important but early pipeline opportunity with their early program in male pattern baldness which we can talk about a little later as well. 
Turning to slide five you can really see a pictorial here that really I think shows this incredible strategic logic of this deal. With BOTOX and VOLUMA, JUVEDERM and SKINMEDICA we have a very strong and leading position in facial aesthetics and we are highly relevant to our customer base both plastic surgeons and dermatologists, with KYBELLA now in the fold we\'ve really I think strengthened that position allowing our leading industry sales force to continue to leverage their relationships sell more products to their existing customer base and we believe and I\'ll explain in a minute continue to expand the market for facial aesthetic products, not just KYBELLA but all of our products BOTOX, VOLUMA, JUVEDERM and SKINMEDICA.
Turning to slide six you\'ll see that this is really about extending our growth platform, we have a strong focus on growth assets and we believe that KYBELLA along with our platforms and fillers and neurotoxins and neuromodulators in BOTOX really I think set us up for sustained growth over the next 10-20 years and so we\'re very excited about adding this platform technology in KYBELLA to our product mix. 
Moving to slide seven to talk about KYBELLA, this is a very well developed clinical program. It was done with almost 20 clinical trials and about 1,600 patients have been treated with KYBELLA, the results were not only statistically significant but more importantly visibly significant and obviously the safety was well characterized. 
When we look at the number of treatments patients may need it really will be individualized to the patient. We believe much like real life experience with VOLUMA and Botox, physicians will manage the number of treatments accordingly depending on the type of reduction they\'re looking for and the size of the chin or submental fat region they\'re dealing with and that could be anywhere from two to four but the label does allow for up to six treatments.
Moving on to slide eight, when you look at the opportunities and why this strategic fit makes so much sense, we tend to look for a couple of things. We look at large markets and clearly facial aesthetics is a large and growing marketplace, we look for an unmet opportunity and submental fat reduction or fat reduction in the face is all white space right now. There are no products that address the submental region of the face, and we know that we have concerned customers that 68% of consumers expressed that excess fat under their chin was extremely bothersome. And so when you put that all together, we believe with our expertise in launching and building markets in Allergan, our leadership position in facial aesthetics around the world, that we are the perfect team to work with KYTHERA to make sure that this product is launched and ultimately a big growth driver for the next 20 plus years. 
When we think about in our hands what this asset can do on slide nine we really do believe that leveraging our leadership position in facial aesthetics will do allow this product to grow faster and ultimately be bigger than if KYTHERA were to do it alone. And we really think that we\'re going to focus on two or three patient groups. First it will be those that are already users of our products and our competitive products that are comfortable with facial injections, we believe that will be the initial target for KYBELLA. We also believe that because of the high concerns that patients have in the unaddressable market for submental fat or double chin that exists that we will be able to bring na\xc3\xafve patients into this market and then most importantly as I have spoken about before we think that this may be a product that really resonates with men and should give us an opportunity to continue our current quest to build out the short aesthetics market for men and this may be a very important product in doing just that. 
I\'m going to turn it over to Tessa for slide 10, just to quickly talk about the deal structure.
Tessa Hilado
Thank you Brent, good morning everyone. Allergan will be purchasing KYTHERA at approximately $75 per share for a total deal of approximately $2.1 billion, 80% will be in cash and 20% will be in equity for about $1.6 billion in net cash. There will be no impact to our previous 2015 EPS forecast and with acquisition will be accretive in 2017. 
In addition the transaction as structured will allow Allergan to repeat investment grade ratings with stable outlook. We remain committed to de-levering the 3.5 times debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2016. Now passing it back on to Brent.
Brent Saunders
Great. Thanks Tessa. So in a second we\xe2\x80\x99ll open it up for Q&A but quickly on Slide 11 in terms of next steps -- KYTHERA shareholders do have to vote on this transaction. Our shareholders do not need to vote on this transaction. We have the normal customary anti-trust approvals Hart Scott Rodino and we expect this deal to close in the third quarter of this year.
And so with that I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it back to Lisa who can start the Q&A.
Lisa DeFrancesco
Okay Maria, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re ready for questions. I\xe2\x80\x99d ask that everybody limit themselves to one question please.
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Umer Raffat of Evercore ISI.
Umer Raffat
Thank you guys for taking my questions. Congrats on the deal. If I limit myself to one question I think what I will ask is your thoughts on the injection burden, how you think about the injection burden for KYTHERA versus their competitors, ZELTIQ and also perhaps if you could put the injection burden into context with the number of injections you need and the recovery time on some of the fillers and toxins, etc. Just want to understand that specific angle.
Brent Saunders
So I don\xe2\x80\x99t really view KYBELLA all that competitive with CoolSculpting from ZELTIQ. They are developing a plate I guess for submental fat but I think freezing the bottom of your chin which for many patients creates numbness that can last for a few weeks and irritation to the skin isn\xe2\x80\x99t as uncomfortable as a once and done kind of injection procedure. Yes there are some more needles to this type of injection, but when you talk to physicians that participated in the clinical trial or have gone through the initial training with KYTHERA they\xe2\x80\x99re very comfortable with how to manage the number of injections and don\xe2\x80\x99t view it as a competitive area with CoolSculpting and which they do like for body contouring, not necessarily for the face. And Philippe do you have anything else to add?
Philippe Schaison
No I agree with you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think those two technologies will compete against each other, very different probably price point and results. I expect KYBELLA to capture most of our market share in the submental fat and we\xe2\x80\x99re very excited about it.
Operator
Our next question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.
Chris Schott
Thanks very much for the question and congrats. Can you talk a little bit about the sales ramp and peak sales opportunity for KYBELLA? I think KYTHERA had been talking about a very slow initial ramp as they trained physicians. Is there anything that Allergan can do to accelerate that process? And then on the peak sales again KYTHERA had again talked about a $500 million US opportunity and maybe an equal sized ex-US opportunity. How are you thinking about peaks sales at this point or is there any comments you can make on that front?
Brent Saunders
Yes, good question Chris. Because the deal won\xe2\x80\x99t close till the third quarter and we have to operator as a separate company still it does close, KYTHERA will continue their training program which we think is very smart and well designed, if we were launching at this point we would probably train an exponential number of physicians given our resources, but I think what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing is incredibly smart and the appropriate way to do it. Once the deal closes I think you\'ll see us ramp much faster than KYTHERA could have on their own, even our size and scale. And so my sense is that the time to peak sales will be quicker in our hands than it will be in theirs.
Keep in mind till we don\xe2\x80\x99t plan on eliminating any sales rep physicians, certainly we\xe2\x80\x99ll integrate the KYTHERA reps after closing into our sales force. But this will give us a really strong leading industry position in sales in facial aesthetics in the U.S. market. As you think about ex-U.S. the same thing where KYTHERA had a very smart strategy around getting approval in Switzerland and Australia and Canada, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking at more markets because of our broader footprint and we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be able to when approved accelerate launch and training as well. And so I think as you think about peak sales I understand KYTHERA\xe2\x80\x99s guidance, we should be able to do better than they did.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank.
Gregg Gilbert
My first question, Brent, is whether you will be trying the product at the town halls today, not saying that you need it but that is 1A. 1B is can you talk about development plans for other parts of the body? I know your focus for some time will be for submental fat but can you talk about how you think about the applicability of the product and the platform to other parts of the body longer-term? Thanks.
Brent Saunders
Sure. So as far as I know, I\'m not getting injection at the town hall today, but I was surprised the last time so it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible. Actually when we\xe2\x80\x99re done this call I\'m visiting some dermatologists and plastic surgeons so that they may try to give me the product which always happens, so who knows, and I am sure I need it, that 68% of people who have concern about their double chin. That maybe more information than you needed. 
I think with respect to other parts of the body the main strategic rational in this deal was to extend our leadership in facial aesthetics and really not all achieved a faster ramp and a larger peak sales on KYBELLA but also to use this to extend into new markets and new patients, not just KYBELLA but all of our facial aesthetic products like BOTOX, JUV\xc3\x89DERM and VOLUMA. And so this is really -- help with all of our portfolio grow in facial aesthetics. Clearly second to that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking at extension to the body. We have always thought about the next logical place after the face would be to extend into body contouring and aesthetics. Whether or not this particular product will allow us to do it, it still remains to be seen, it\'s something that our R&D team will be challenged to try to understand and look at. David\'s here I don\'t know if he wants to chime in, but certainly if it is something that can be extended to the other regions of the body or behind the arms or other places like that, we\'ll certainly will give a very careful consideration.
David Nicholson
This is David Nicholson. Good morning everyone. I have got huge respect for what the R&D team at KYTHERA has achieved so far with KYBELLA and we just started to talk to them about if and how we should extend the use to other regions of the body and get regulatory approval for other forms of fat reduction and really look forward to working with the team there to progress those discussions. It is a bit early obviously to be too definitive. 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin 
Thank you and I extend my congratulations as well. KYTHERA has talked about premium pricing in the range of $3000 to $5000 per patient for a full treatment and my understanding is that they were set to announce that at the time of launch imminently. Since your deal doesn\'t close with them until the third quarter, Brent, can you comment on pricing and most importantly are you involved in the pricing decisions? Thanks very much. Just one last question, how come this isn\'t an all cash deal? Thanks. 
Brent Saunders
Sure, so let\'s take pricing first, we have to operate as two separate companies until close as you know under the rules and we always maintain a very strong compliance around that. That being said, they do plan to continue with their launch which includes pricing. We have had some very high level conversations about pricing. Their team is an incredibly talented team, they have done an incredible amount of research and we\xe2\x80\x99re highly confident that they will set the prices as you directed it as a premium product in a range that we think is incredibly appropriate. That being said, we can\'t control it, but we certainly understand what they are doing and support what they are doing.
On the deal structure Jami, the reason we did use all cash is that first and foremost is our strong commitment to maintain our investment grade rating and so we did meet with all three rating agencies and we are in a very comfortable position with the rating agencies. We also wanted to structure the deal to allow some flexibility for additional deals for the remainder of the year. And so when we looked at this deal and recognizing that our stock is a bit undervalued as we discussed in conference last week. This meant the threshold of high strategic value and achieved all the financial metrics of using a limited amount of stock to make the deal happen. So we feel very comfortable at the deal structure allowing us to maintain our objective of investment grade rating and keeping some fire power for future deals.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Doug Tsao of Barclays.
Doug Tsao
Just Brent, maybe just follow up on Jami\'s last point in terms of how you are thinking about using stock right now, obviously you have sort of expressed a view in terms of being undervalued and just how should we think about sort of the use of Allergan stock as currency on future deals and certainly as you want to continue to keep the cadence of deals go through the rest of the year? Thanks. 
Brent Saunders
I would be very clear of this, the use of stock here is not presidential, we set this value, we do think our stock is undervalued because of the high strategic rational, the commitment to investment grade and the high hurdles that this deal met it was appropriate for cash, I mean for a limited amount of equity in the deal mix. But it\'s not something I would do regularly. I think if we were to do future deals they would be structured entirely in cash so long as we can maintain our investment grade rating, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s how we tend to approach these types of deals. If we were to use stock for a deal in the future it would have to be incredibly strategic, the financial metrics would have to clearly be able to compensate for what we believe is an undervalued equity and it would probably be kind of a last choice situation in order to maintain the investment grade. 
Operator
Our next question comes from line of Sumant Kulkarni of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Sumant Kulkarni
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Brent, you mentioned high-level pricing discussions with KYTHERA on the product. So were there any conceptual differences in the way that you are thinking about pricing relative to KYTHERA\'s thought process especially because one of your sites mentions that no retreatment is necessary in this case? 
Brent Saunders 
Yes to be clear we did have discussions, they\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of told us what they had done. It was a work related discussion and we listened to what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing but clearly we haven\'t influenced or had any return conversation around pricing. I think that being said we are very comfortable that they understand the market they have done a very detailed review of the opportunity. I think that their team is incredibly talented. The people that have worked with me and Allergan in the past leading that team and we have great confidence in them. And they haven\xe2\x80\x99t made a final decision I believe with respect to what the price will be but I think we\'re very comfortable that they\'ll make a good decision given all the data and work they\xe2\x80\x99ve done in this area. And we don\xe2\x80\x99t see that as a concern. 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham of Citi.
Liav Abraham
Good morning and congrats. My question is around physician incentivation. Can you talk a little bit about physician incentivation dynamics around current standard of care which I understand includes more interventional treatments versus the dynamics surrounding KYBELLA going forward and how this can potentially aid in the uptake of the treatment when its launched? Thank you. 
Brent Saunders
I think I\'ll ask Philippe to perhaps comment here as well. Good question really, I do think that when you talk to physicians that have been in the trials or have gone through the training, they\'re very comfortable with the product; they understand how to use it and how to target patients. I think as we continue to or they continue to launch the product as we enter the market we have great experience in training physicians and to how to talk to their patients., how to build their practices around these products and portfolio of products and I suspect it will be a rising tide situation with more products and more areas that they face to eject they\'ll be looking to do more complete facial aesthetic programs with their patients that will include BOTOX, the fillers and KYBELLA to do more of a non-invasive face lifter or facial rejuvenation type program. Philippe do you want to add anything?
Philippe Schaison
Yes cross selling is right in our wheelhouse. We are running a lot of training, teaching physicians and injectors on how to do a full face rejuvenation and KYBELLA speaking to our portfolio. So I have no doubt in my mind that we\'re going to be able to achieve our objective and to offer consumers the full facial rejuvenation offering. Furthermore we have a group of what we called APC, Allergan Parties Consultant and they teach the physicians of the practice on how to recruit more consumers and offer the full range of products that we have in our bag. So when you combine the two together, the training plus our APC groups there is no doubt in my mind that we are then to grow that business even further. 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Maris of BMO Capital Markets.
David Maris
Good morning. Just a quick question, you mentioned that it is accretive in 2017. Can you tell us what the sales base that\'s assumed? And I would imagine that it would be easily be accretive just because of the salesforce and you have the salesforce already but is there anything else that we should be thinking about from an R&D standpoint spending-wise going into 2017, 2018? Thank you
Brent Saunders
Good question thanks David. So we do believe that we\'ll be breakeven in the first year and then accretive in \'17 as we said. I think a large reason for that is it\'s a product launch. So we\'ll be investing heavily behind the product as it\'s being launched to drive demand. We\'ll be investing heavily in training of physicians and so that\xe2\x80\x99s why you get the breakeven in the first year versus accretion in the first year. And we\'re not giving out sales by year yet. But perhaps we will after the deal closes. I think with the R&D we are I think very excited about the male pattern baldness asset it\'s early maybe I\'ll ask David to just quickly comment on that. And then the last thing I would say is in terms of spending there is some work to do to get the international approvals, there could depending on how we ultimately forward by a country like Japan which this will be very nice opportunity for would require some additional clinical work. And that\xe2\x80\x99s also something we have to consider as we go forward. 
David Nicholson
And yes so clearly there will be some R&D spend on KYBELLA as Brent has just outlined. Regarding the pipeline project, it\'s a prostaglandin D2 inhibitor, looks very interesting. Some really nice work at the University of Pennsylvania has gone a long way towards validating the fact that you get enhanced expression of prostaglandin D2 in areas of male pattern baldness and that you can reverse male pattern baldness by administrating an inhibitor, prostaglandin D2. Having said that, this is very early project to further team at planning to file an IND very soon and move into some more definitive clinical trials -- really looking forward to getting involved in our program, it\'s exciting.
David Maris
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Elliot Robert of Raymond James.
Elliot Robert
Thank and good morning, maybe just sticking with the same schematic, beyond the new term accretion metrics you spoke to the press release, is there anything you could say at this point in terms of expected payback period and when you would expect transaction to be positive on a ROIC basis, thanks.
Unidentified Company Representative
Yes, we\'re probably not prepared to disclose that at this point but perhaps we will closer to the close. Suffice it to say it didn\'t satisfy our very disciplined and tough criteria on all those fronts. And then most importantly the strategic rationale for the deal and what it does to help support our leadership position in sales and marketing arena, in facial aesthetics in the United States. What it does to help extend the market to na\xc3\xafve patients and perhaps even men, I think really gives us many LIBORs for future upside as well. So we\'ve applied the standard discipline we always have on deals and this deal certainly fit that criteria, but it has the added benefit of also extending our leadership and allowing us to have many cross sell opportunities in the future.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen we have time for one final question. Our final question will come from the line of Andrew Finkelstein of Susquehanna.
Andrew Finkelstein
Thanks very much for taking the question. Could you talk at all, or maybe you could expand on the last point about the ability to bring in new patients, how much overlap do you see in expanding this treatment to your current patients versus the demographics you think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be able to attract and what you\'re going to be able to sell to them and does that, do you look at that any differently than perhaps Allergan did prior to the acquisition? Does this asset make more sense to you now because it\'s approved and because of the tax structure or did you fundamentally look at the potential for it differently than in the past.
Unidentified Company Representative
I\'ll take the back part first and then we can talk about the market and Philippe Schaison can add his thoughts here. It\'s hard to say we thought about it differently than the old Allergan, I think the facial aesthetics team and the Allergan medical teams have always been impressed by this asset, clearly the derisking events of having it approved makes it all the more interesting but it\'s not really has anything to do with the tax status of our company. It really is about the strategic rationale and then creating another growth driver and platform for us in our largest therapy area which is aesthetic medicine and in particular facial aesthetics. I think in terms of bringing patients into the practice as I said that the data that we have and we have probably the best data in the world, shows that submental fat or double chin is probably one of the areas of the face that overwhelming number of patients high 60% are extreme concerned about. And this is the first and only treatment approved for it. 
When you talk to physicians I would tell you that they say this is a huge opportunity for them to really help patients feel better about their face and then to potentially attract more patients. Ultimately I think bringing na\xc3\xafve patients into the practice including perhaps men which make up a small you know close to 12% - 13% of all facial aesthetics, I think that\'s where our expertise in building markets, our expertise in direct to consumer advertising, our leadership position in facial aesthetics really come into play and so I think if anyone can do it we can. It won\'t be easy but I think we have all the right strategies, all the right capabilities and all the right resources to do it. Philippe you want to add your thoughts?
Philippe Schaison
I think you covered the two points, we have our current users and 30% of them are great candidate for KYBELLA, and then you have the na\xc3\xafve patient that we\'re trying to chase and there\'s a huge unmet need, we know that there are more than 13 million women sitting on the fence, buttering to be injected and KYBELLA is going to be a major initiative to try to bring them into the practice. So and lastly -- and you said that Brent is the male patients, we only have 5% of them being injected today. This is a huge unmet need and a cross selling opportunity, bring them into the KYBELLA and you cross-sell that with BOTOX, you know JUV\xc3\x89DERM and VOLUMA. So it\'s an exciting time.
Andrew Finkelstein
Thanks very much.
Lisa DeFrancesco
Brent would you like to make any closing remarks?
Brent Saunders
Yes I would just thank everyone for getting on the call last minute. Obviously this is a very important strategic tuck-in deal for us. We\'re very excited to welcome the KYTHERA team to Allergan when this deal closes in Q3. David, Philippe and I are excited to head over there in just an hour and so and do some town halls and meet and greet, and one-on-ones with the KYTHERA folks. But this is really about extending our leadership in facial aesthetics and we\'re excited to bring this product in our male pattern baldness pipeline project into the Allergan fold upon close and I thank you for your time today. 
Lisa DeFrancesco
Thanks everyone.
