Good morning. My name is Phyllis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Watson\'s Fourth Quarter and Yearend 2007 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)
Thank you. Ms. Eisenhaur, you may begin your conference.
Patty Eisenhaur
Thank you, Phyllis and good morning everyone. I\'d like to welcome you to Watson\'s fourth quarter and yearend 2007 earnings conference call. 
Earlier this morning, Watson issued a press release reporting its earnings for the fourth quarter and yearend 2007. The press release is available on our website at www.watson.com. 
Additionally, we are conducting a live webcast of this call, which will also be available on our website after the call\'s conclusion. With us today are Paul Bisaro, our President and CEO, and Mark Durand, Watson\'s CFO. Also present and available during the Q&A portion of the call are Tom Russillo, President of the Generics Division; Ed Heimers, President of our Brand Division; David Buchen our General Counsel; and Todd Joyce, Watson\'s Corporate Controller.
During the formal portion of today\'s call, Paul will provide an overview of our results for the quarter and full year. Mark will then provide further details of our financial performance for the quarter. Lastly, Paul will conclude our presentation with some comments on our outlook for 2008. We\'ll then open up the call for questions and answers.

I\'d like to now turn the call over to Paul Bisaro, our President and CEO.
Paul Bisaro
Thank you Patty and good morning everyone. We\'re please to announce our results for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2007. Our consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter were $627 million, which is up slightly from the $621 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Revenues for the full year of 2007 were $2.5 billion compared to $2 billion in fiscal 2006 or 26% increase. Our GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.34 and our adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.35.
On an annual basis, our GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2007 were $1.27, and our adjusted earnings per share for the same period were $1.37. Our new CFO, Mark Durand will provide more details on our financial results in a little bit.
Now turning to our Generics business and some of the highlights for 2007. We launched 16 new generic products in 2007, including three key ones, Bupropion XL 300 milligram, transdermal Fentanyl, and Tilia FE. We expect these products to continue to be important contributors in 2008. 
We also filed 21 ANDAs with the FDA in 2007, with a goal to file at least the same amount or more in 2008. As I have said in the past, we are working on balancing our Generic portfolio by combining a mix of commodity-like products that we can be cost-competitive on, while aggressively moving on developing differentiated products that should provide higher and longer lasting returns.
That gives us about 60 ANDAs pending at the FDA right now. As you may know, we rationalized our Generic pipeline, or ANDA pending at the FDA late last year, and this was done to focus our resources and products which still have value, and not use resources on products that we didn\'t think could drive value in the future. 
During 2007, we continued to make important progress on our strategic initiative, aimed at reducing our cost structure and enhancing operating efficiencies. In 2007, we realized more than $30 million in cost savings from the closure of our Puerto Rico facility, and the sale of our Phoenix Injectable plant. 
In addition, our facilities in India are beginning to come online. Our Goa finished dosage plant, received FDA clearance to begin making products for the U.S. market, and in fact we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun shipping the first products from that facility for sale in the U.S. This continuing effort and cost containment across our entire supply chain, has also resulted in us making a decision to further consolidate our U.S. facilities. We have decided to close our Carmel, New York facilities no later than the end of 2010.
The decision to close the Carmel facilities was very difficult, as it will ultimately have an impact on our employees. But given our current facilities, the capacity in those facilities, the technology based in our facilities, and the relative age of all of our facilities Carmel was the logical choice. Lastly, this year we completed the integration of Andrx. There is one outstanding item however, and as we announced last week, the FDA has initiated an inspection of our Florida facilities. We have no further information to share regarding that inspection, but we remain hopeful that we will have a satisfactory inspection and be removed from OAI status.
Finally a few other generic highlights and they are from the legal group. We settled the Cardizem LA litigation, which gave us the right to launch the product Cardizem LA generic product in April 2009. Next, we completed the trial on Concerta in December and we currently await the outcome of that trial.
We also monetizes the Metoprolol XL 50 milligram opportunity, and continue to receive royalties from Sandoz. Finally we settled our litigation with Biovail, which allowed us to launch Bupropion XL 300-milligram, and continue to receive royalties on Wellbutrin XL 150 milligram from GSK. 
Now turning to our brand segment. Our urology portfolio continues to grow. First Silodosin, as we announced last week our NDA was accepted for filing and we anticipated FDA action on our application in the fourth quarter 2008. This product will be the first new chemical entity in Watson\xe2\x80\x99s history. Silodosin is used to treat BPH, which is the number one disease treated by urologists in the US. Silodosin is highly efficacious
Many of you have asked about when data is expected to be presented, or published on this product. And we are pleased to report today that Silodosin\'s strong electrocardiac profile will be highlighted at a podium presentation of this year\xe2\x80\x99s American Urology Association meeting in late May. 
Our Oxybutynin topical gel for overactive bladder will also be profiled at this year\xe2\x80\x99s AUA meeting. PK data related to delivery profile will be presented at the meeting. Our NDA preparations for this product remain on track, and we expect to have an application on file with FDA in the middle of this year. Overactive bladder is the number three disease treated by urologists. 
Finally, Debiopharm recently presented positive data on Trelstar six months formulation at a European conference. Pending final analysis of the Phase 3 data, we plan to file in NDA for that product in the second half of 2008.
Turning now to our Distribution business, after one complete operating year under Watson, we have a better sense of what this business can offer us, and how it affects our overall corporate performance. This business does move in tandem with the generic industry as a whole, and is dependent in part on successful launches of new Generic products. The late 2007 launch of Generic Protonix by Teva gave the Endo business a nice boost for the fourth quarter and positively influenced its margins over the third quarter\'s results.
As you can see 2007 was a very eventful year. In addition to all the activities I described above, we have also added some new members to our management team including Mark Durand, the CFO who joined us from Teva and the recent employment of Francois Menard, as Senior Vice President of Generics Research and Development, who joined us from Sandoz. I\'m very confident that with the addition of these new folks combined with our existing talent, we\'ll have very exciting things to come for Watson in 2008.
With that, I\'ll turn the call over to Mark. Mark?
Mark Durand
Thanks, Paul, and good morning to all. I\'ll now review highlights of our fourth quarter financial results on both the consolidated and divisional basis. For the fourth quarter 2007, net revenues were $627 million up slightly from $621 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Gross profit increased 20% in the fourth quarter to $254 million compared to $211 million in the fourth quarter 2006. The consolidated gross margin increased on a year-over-year basis to 40.5%. This enhanced gross margin was due primarily to the growth of other revenue within both our Brand and Generic divisions.
Turning to our Divisional performance, our fourth quarter Generic division net revenue was $374 million consisting of $344 million in product sales, and $30 million in other revenue. Total Generic revenue was up 5% from the third quarter levels due to increased product sales, as Paul mentioned the launches of Bupropion XL 300-milligram, transdermal Fentanyl and Tilia Fe.
Compared to the fourth quarter 2006, Generic revenues are down $47 million or 11%. The loss of revenue from oxycodone ER tablet following the termination of our distribution agreement was partially offset by the growth in other revenue. Generic gross margins increased substantially year-over-year, to 40.1% in the fourth quarter 2006, and this was due primarily to the increase in other revenue, and improvement in product mix and enhanced operating efficiencies.
Moving on to the Brand division. Net revenue for the fourth quarter was $109 million, and consisted of $94 million of product sales, and $15 million of other revenue, as it is up slightly from the $107 million reported in both the third quarter of \'07, and the fourth quarter of 2006. For the fourth quarter, specialty product sales were $54 million down 2% from the fourth quarter of 2006, and nephrology sales came in at $41 million, down 4% on a year-over-year basis.
Other brand revenue was $15 million up 56% from the prior year quarter, reflecting co-promotion revenue from AndroGel and other licensing revenue. Brand gross margin in the fourth quarter was 76.4% up two percentage points on a year-over-year basis. The increase in Brand gross margin was a result of an increased proportion of other revenue.
And finally net revenue from the distribution division was $144 million. Distribution revenue was up $14 million or 11% sequentially from the third quarter of 2007, and the increase was related to new product launches following a relatively low level of launches in the third quarter Also distribution gross margin was 14.4%, an increase of 1.7 percentage points from the third quarter.
Tuning to our operating expenses, R&D spending for the fourth quarter was $36 million, down slightly from last year due to lower R&D spending within the brand division, as activity for certain Phase III trials came to an end.
SG&A for the quarter was $108 million, an increase of $5 million over the prior year quarter. Amortization for the fourth quarter was $44 million and includes the last quarter of amortization for Ferrlecit, which is fully amortized. Amortization in total for 2007 was $176 million and to be clear we expect amortization for 2008 to be approximately $80 million.
GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $0.34 on an adjusted basis, excluding acquisition related charges, debt repurchase costs and other adjustments, Watson\'s fourth quarter adjusted net income was $39.7 million or $0.35 per share. Now adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $137 million, a slight increase over third quarter levels. Our press release from earlier this morning has a reconciliation table of these adjustments.
And now turning briefly to the balance sheet and cash flow: Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter continued to be strong and was a $171 million, yielding $427 million in cash-flow for the year. While we expect continued strong cash flows for 2008, we don\'t expect cash flow to be quite at these levels.
Capital expenditures for the year were approximately $75 million. As of the end of the fourth quarter, cash and marketable securities were $216 million, total debt payments in 2007 were $329 million. At the year end, our debt was approximately $900 million and our debt to capitalization ratio was 33%.
In the fourth quarter of 2008, we paid down another $75 million, leaving approximately $250 million outstanding under our senior credit facility and 575 million of outstanding convertible debentures.
With that I\'ll turn the call back over to Paul to further discuss the forecast and provide concluding remarks.
Paul Bisaro
Thanks Mark. And before we move to Q&A, I want to just share with you our current expectations, and outlook for 2008. In fiscal 2008, we expect consolidated revenues to be approximately $2.5 billion. We expect Generic revenues to be between $1.45 billion and $1.55 billion.
Our forecast of course, is affected by a number of items. One assumption is that we are successful in resolving the Davie, Florida OAI situation by approximately mid-year. Also we are expecting about 10% price erosion in our Generic base business consistent with what we saw last year. We are also assuming a decline in other Generic revenue principally due to the Metoprolol of 50-millogram product, losing exclusivity in mid-March.
Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts in this assumption. We may have more or less competition on certain products, the timing surrounding the resolution of OAI, the timing of new Generic product launches and approvals, all can influence the results of our Generic segment.
On the Brand front, we expect Brand revenues to increase slightly to somewhere between $420 million and $440 million. Probably the biggest budget assumption is related to Ferrlecit. Our 2008 forecast assumes continued erosion Ferrlecit sales, but doesn\'t include a Generic entrant or a major new product competing directly with Ferrlecit.
Looking beyond 2008, we expect competing product approvals in this category. And our license supply and distribution agreements with Sanofi-Aventis are currently set to expire at the end of 2009. Although, we are in discussions with Sanofi-Aventis to extend these agreements, we cannot predict at this time whether we will be successful in negotiating extension.
So, whether it\'s due to Generic approvals, new Brand competitors, the outcome of our negotiation with Sanofi-Aventis or some combination of all of these events, the economic surrounding Ferrlecit will change, and we assume that change will occur sometime after 2008. 
As I\'ve said we are working very hard in the brand division and reducing our dependence on Ferrlecit. We believe our solid brand pipeline, which includes Silodosin and OxyGel, will help us more than offset the revenues by 2010.
Turning to our ANDA distribution business, while we have a number of new business initiatives underway, net revenues will remain primarily dependent on generic product launches. As we expect it to contribute between $580 million and $610 million in that revenue.
During the operating expenses, we expect R&D spending to be between $160 million and $170 million, with about 65-35 split between Generics and brands. SG&A expenses are expected to be between $420 million and $440 million, reflecting slightly higher sales and marketing spend in front of the Silodosin product launch, which is anticipated in early 2009. However depending on the timing of the Silodosin launch, we could see additional spending in the second half to support that launch.
For 2008, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.90 and $2 per share. We anticipate the earnings per share will be weighted more to the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $555 million and $575 million. Just to conclude, we expect a lot of activity in 2008 and we will continue to build on the momentum that we started in 2007.
We\'ll continue to focus our efforts on our cost initiatives in building our Generic and brand pipelines. With that I\'ll turn it back over to Patty and then open it up for questions.
Patty Eisenhaur
So, we can get the Q&A underway.
Operator
(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gilbert with Merrill Lynch.
Patty Eisenhaur
Good morning Greg.
Greg Gilbert - Merrill Lynch
Good morning. I will ask a couple upfront and then get back in line. First, can you quantify what \'08 guidance would look like, if the OAI status is not resolved at all? And secondly since Generic Protonix looked like it was key driver for ANDA, can you provide some color on that product, such as who you brought from, whether supply continues and any other color you can offer? Thanks.
Paul Bisaro
Sure. Greg, on S3 OAI, we are not prepared at this time to quantify what the difference would be with and without an OAI resolution. We are hopeful that that resolution will take place and we\'ll be able to begin shipping new products out of our facilities down in Florida by mid-year, but we are not prepared to give you what it would look like with or without that.
Regarding the Generic Protonix, we did get Generic Protonix from Teva. We also bought from other suppliers as well in our ANDA business, and right now while we continue to sell the remaining inventory that we have, we are not currently acquiring products from any source at the moment.
Greg Gilbert - Merrill Lynch
Is material available for purchase currently?
Paul Bisaro
I do not believe that is true.
Greg Gilbert - Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thanks I will get back in line.
Paul Bisaro
Okay.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang with FTN Midwest Securities.
Tim Chiang - FTN Midwest Securities
Can you provide a little bit more color on what the on what the mechanics are between now and mid-year. You put a press release out about the FDA being at the Florida facility. What has to happen between now and then?
Paul Bisaro
Sure I can give you some more color on that. What we anticipate is, the FDA has arrived with a number of inspectors as anticipated. We expect this inspection to last a number of weeks, sort of depending on FDA schedule. And then normally what would happen is, we anticipate some dialogue between us and the FDA regarding their observations, and then based on the results of the overall inspection.
We expect that the district and the inspectors will make a recommendation one way or the other to the district, and to ultimately the center in Washington DC, and we hope that is positive. That process could take anywhere from weeks to months and so we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to do whatever we can to obviously move it along, but a lot of this depends on the FDA\'s ability and timing and their availability.
Tim Chiang - FTN Midwest Research
I recall last year, you had a certain number of points that the FDA had observations on, and I remember Allen had talked about how those had been riddled down. I mean are was there a very defined question mark that the FDA had before coming into the facility, and is this is a pretty cut and dry fight scenario here.
Paul Bisaro
Well Tim I think the FDA comes under general GMP inspection. So they can touch on any aspect of our operations in Florida. They can touch on R&D, they can touch on packaging, and they can touch on manufacturing, quality, validations everything. So we anticipate that they will do a through inspection on the facility.
We also anticipate that there will be some issues that we have to manage and talk to them about. That\'s not unusual inspection of this kind, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of that, we just know that occurs. We will then respond to whatever observations they have and hopefully we will respond satisfactorily for them. 
Tim Chiang - FTN Midwest Research
Is it a way you can list some of the major products you would expect to launch or make and launch in the second half of the year out of this facility? Would it include Toprol XL, would include Prilosec?
Paul Bisaro
It would include the Omeprazole 40, it would include Metoprolol. There are a number of other products that we\xe2\x80\x99ve disclosed, as part of certain patent challenges. In that facility we have our conservative product. We also have the Actos-Metformin
Tim Chiang - FTN Midwest Research
Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen and Company. 
Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company
Good morning. Just a couple of questions following up on the last one. On Concerta have you actually had any interactions with the FDA beyond simply some manufacturing hold? So have you had any more detail discussions on the approvability of that product, and as well I see you recently filed the petition on Cantazar. Can you talk about the potential for exclusivity, I believe today is the potential approval date on that product, and then if I have a chance one follow-up quarter?
Paul Bisaro
Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll work on the Cantazar first, and we do expect approval of our product today. We filed a paragraph four certification on that product, and we were not sued, and we believe we\xe2\x80\x99re entitled to 180 day of exclusivity on that product. It appears that other folks have filed Paragraph III, and have carved out the language that was patent-protected.
Our Citizens petition says that we don\'t think that was appropriate in this particular case. The FDA will make its decision. We anticipate they will make their decision today on the merits of our Citizens petition.
Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company
Does the guidance reflective of exclusive launch or is it reflective of the competitive launch?
Paul Bisaro
Our guidance does not include upsides from patent challenges or opportunities like this.
Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company
Okay. And on Concerta?
Paul Bisaro
The focus for us on Concerta was the trial. We focused on that, and that trials have been completed. The application right now is sort of pending resolution of the OAI status in Florida. We would anticipate that the FDA would pickup or look at the Citizens petitions around the Concerta product at the time when our application is ready for approval, as that\'s sort of been their normal practice. I would anticipate that they would follow that same practice here.
Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company
Okay. And just one last question on the manufacturing. The oral contraceptives, I fail to remember whether they have been transferred out, or would the manufacturing hold allow for competitive oral contraceptive launches after that product. I\'m forgetting--
Paul Bisaro
What are you speaking about there I think, is the products that were sold that\'s part of the acquisition Watson\'s acquisition of Andrx products that were sold to Teva.
Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company
Right.
Paul Bisaro
Teva is in charge of how and where and when they are going to make the products. We have an obligation to make some products for them. If the products are held up by OAI, they are held up by OAI, but Teva is actively working to move the product. So, you\'ll have to ask them where they are at the process.
Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company
Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Paul Bisaro
You bet
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with Credit Suisse.
Marc Goodman - Credit Suisse
Questions first of all, can you help us what the in the pipeline for the Generics. How many are the first to file opportunities and maybe you can mention some of the other public ones that haven\'t been talked about on the call yet? Second of all, can you talk about the products flow out of India, how many you expect new products to come out this year and next year just give us an update on that whole thing?
And third on the guidance in the Brand business, is there an assumption that all of these older products that are really marketed, but they just stay flat, or are there pricing assumptions going up the Brand revenue guidance that seem to be a little higher then what I thought it would be? Thanks.
Paul Bisaro
Well let me, I\'ll start from the bottom up. On the older products or the legacy brand products that we\'ve that we no longer detail. We anticipate our guidance will anticipate sort of year-over-year declines in units, but like any other brand product, we would anticipate some price increases in those products year-over-year.
Brand forecast is based on a number of moving parts including the products we\'re currently promoting, and I think we feel good about the 350 sales reps we\'ve out in the field right now, detailing our products to urologists, nephrologists, endocrinologist, and gynecologist. So, we feel good about what\'s going on in that group. And we think we\'re very comfortable with the numbers we gave on the brand revenue projections.
Marc Goodman - Credit Suisse
So, as far as the products you are promoting OxyGel, Trelstar?
Paul Bisaro
OxyGel, Trelstar, ProQuin, Tri-Luma, AndroGel and Ferrlecit. We remember we have three distinct sales forces that we use. Nephrology group focuses on Ferrlecit and INFeD, our Urology group and then our specialty group. Yes, about product flows out of India, principally the products that are moving from India, they\'ll be manufactured in India today for the US market.
Our products there are being transferred from, right now our Carmel facility to India. And so they are older manufacturing products for us and what you are seeing, what you should see is a margin expansion opportunity for those products. And over time that margin expansion will be translated into more value of the products selling out of there.
This year we anticipate doing about 800 million doses out of India, moving on to about 3 billion doses by the end of 2009. The Carmel facility\'s products will move, sort of between the India facility as well as the Florida facility and Corona, and they\'ll take on the extra distribution.
Now, you asked also about other Paragraph IV opportunities we were first to file, I\'d say the other one that we\'ve disclosed at this point is Loestrin 24, that case is still in discovery I believe, and of course we have the seasonal matter pending with Barr although there is no 180 day exclusivity there. We\'ve launched our Generic and they sued us after their patent issue, re-issue.
Patty Eisenhaur
Phyllis?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Buck with Buckingham Research.
David Buck - Buckingham Research
Yes, thanks for taking my question. Just a couple; first on the Carmel plant closing, just trying to understand the, the $34 million, it seems like it\'s ongoing expenses. I just wanted to get a sense of why that\'s being excluded from the guidance since it seems like it\'s an ongoing issue.
Also, can you just breakout the sales of oral contraceptives for the quarter and the full year? And Paul your comments on Ferrlecit it sounds like you are expecting some major competition either Branded or Generic in 2009, but is the expectation at this point that you see overall brands increase in sales in 2009 or you expecting flat to down revenues from that segment? Thanks.
Paul Bisaro
\n', b'
Yeah, just the first part Paul, on the plant
David Buck - Buckingham Research
Okay. So, you\'re excluding just what you see is the sort of one-off charges, okay.
Paul Bisaro
\n', b'
That\'s right. The ongoing operating expenses related to ongoing manufacturing until the close, remain in the P&L.
David Buck - Buckingham Research
Okay. 
Tom Russillo
Hey David, you asked about Ferrlecit. Yeah, I think as we think about Ferrlecit and beyond 2008, as I mentioned we anticipate that something will happen in 2009, or could happen in 2009 with respect to either Generic competitor, or new product entrant into the category both of which would affect that product.
The other remarks had to do with the supply distribution and license agreement with Sanofi-Aventis, which expires at the end of 2009. We are working on negotiating extension to that, but like anything else we try and negotiate, it\'s not clear whether they will actually be able to do that or not. So, that obviously would change the economics surrounding the product as well. We do anticipate changes in Ferrlecit going forward.
Now, we talked about Brand revenues for 2009, we are obviously not giving guidance for 2009, but we anticipate the launch of Silodosin, and we also anticipate getting hopefully, a successful NDA filed on OxyGel, and getting that product launched in 2009. So with at least two major launches in 2009, we would anticipate some upside in the revenues for that segment.
David Buck - Buckingham Research
Okay, great. And just a final one, can you just break out what the Generic OC line was for the quarter?
Mark Durand
Yeah that was $90 million for Q4.
David Buck - Buckingham Research
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Rich Silver with Lehman Brothers.
Paul Bisaro
Hi Rich.
Rich Silver - Lehman Brothers
Good morning Paul. Good morning Mark.
Mark Durand
Hi Rich.
Rich Silver - Lehman Brothers
Just on the earnings for \'08 which you said would be front end loaded. Can we assume that that\'s a function of Fosamax being more heavily weighted in the first half, and SG&A spending more heavily weighted in the second half in anticipation of the Silodosin launch, is that the way we should think about it in terms of the moving parts that contribute to the first half weighting?
Paul Bisaro
You are half right. I think the main driver for the first half weighting is other revenue. Other revenue being in the Generic line, and as I mentioned, it\'s principally the Toprol 50 milligram.
Rich Silver - Lehman Brothers
Okay. So is that more important than what I just mentioned?
Paul Bisaro
To the other, yes.
Rich Silver - Lehman Brothers
Okay. So most heavily weighted toward that relative to the other two things I mentioned?
Paul Bisaro
That\'s correct.
Rich Silver - Lehman Brothers
Okay. Second question is, with the other Generic Duragesic reservoir patches now having been recalled, is there any reason why we should not expect Watson\'s to be recalled as well?
Paul Bisaro
Well, I think that the decision to recall a particular strength of some of these products was a product-by-product and case-by-case basis. And I wouldn\'t extrapolate, it\'s not a situation where you can extrapolate that all reservoir patches are going to be recalled, that\'s not the case here.
Rich Silver - Lehman Brothers
Okay. So your assumption is that --
Paul Bisaro
And by the way and I can\'t speak for the other manufacturers, but I believe they will also say the same thing.
Rich Silver - Lehman Brothers
Okay. So your assumption is a full year of Generic Duragesic in that \'08 guidance.
Paul Bisaro
Yes.
Rich Silver - Lehman Brothers
Okay. And then just one last question on the tax rate, what exactly are you assuming for \'08 and I guess why?
Paul Bisaro
I don\'t think, we are assuming, Rich in \'08, not much of a change.
Rich Silver - Lehman Brothers
No change?
Mark Durand
Rich, slight increase. We are assuming roughly 38.5% in 2008.
Rich Silver - Lehman Brothers
Okay. And then, sorry, one last one, just the higher R&D spending, I know you gave us a breakdown on Generic versus Brand, but given that you are concluding major studies this year, what would account for that increase, is it next year on the brand side.
Paul Bisaro
Well, first of all, in addition to continuing studies with Urasys, But also sort of a milestone payment associated with the product launches of Silodosin, principally Silodosin. 
Rich Silver - Lehman Brothers
On the R&D side?
Paul Bisaro
Yeah. Those would be in the R&D line.
Rich Silver - Lehman Brothers
Okay. Alright. Thanks very much.
Paul Bisaro
You bet.
Operator 
Your next question comes from the line of Elliott Wilbur with Oppenheimer.
Paul Bisaro
Hi, Elliot.
Elliott Wilbur - Oppenheimer
Hey Paul Good morning. I wanted to circle back to or comeback to OAI issue for just a second. Obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s been the over hang on the Andrx business for a couple of years now. But pre-dating that, those facilities themselves had a lot of issues I guess just in terms of production capacity and lot of scale up issues. And I guess the simple question is, are those all fixed now, so that when you do get these approvals we can count on you guys to kind of fully capitalize on these opportunities.
Paul Bisaro
Well it\'s certainly our plan to do that Elliot. The team has worked very hard even before I arrived to start to validate and work on the processes, the manufacturing processes for the products that were pending. And that effort continues, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work on that, and it is my expectation that once OAI is removed, we will see a fair amount of the value coming out of the facility with these new product launches.
As far as capacity goes, the facility is obviously operating under capacity at the moment. We have somewhere between 3 billion and 4 billion doses of capacity, and we\xe2\x80\x99re running a little less than 1 billion right now. 
So, as we get more products through that facility, it will obviously improve the cost position and help overall margins on the generic side. But we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful to get through the OAI inspection as quickly as possible and turn our attention again to getting products launched out of that facility.
Elliott Wilbur - Oppenheimer
And then I had two additional questions for you as well. I understand that Generic Fosamax isn\'t exactly key to the story this year. But in terms of just helping us to sort of gauge the overall health of the industry, can you talk a little bit about the pricing dynamics on the product, and should we still be thinking about kind of high single-digit margin for an authorized generic distributor?
Paul Bisaro
Well every authorized generic situation is a little different. We have said in the past that we like to maintain the highest possible margins on our authorized generics, and you are profitably not too far off from kind of where this product would be. 
The dynamics level underneath though were a little unusual and sort of resulted in lower than expected pricing on the product and so the value of the opportunity diminished fairly significantly. There was dynamics associated with what Merck was doing, there were other competitors - one of the competitors for only one-strength that all sort of affected the dynamics here, and so I think we saw a bit more aggressive pricing behavior than we anticipated. I think we all anticipated and therefore I think the opportunity was less valuable than originally anticipated.
Elliott Wilbur - Oppenheimer
Okay. And then I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you quantified it earlier, if you did I miss that, I apologize, but with respect the shuttering the Carmel, New York facilities, what do you ultimately expect that to translate into in terms of just costs savings?
Paul Bisaro
Yeah, we did not give a magnitude, there\'s obviously a lot of moving parts we know. We sort of know what the costs of operations of the facility are, but of course we now are adding facilities in India that have to be cost in sort of in comparison to. What I mentioned earlier was we took about $30 million of cost out the system in 2007. I think the magnitude of $30 million or higher is what you should be thinking about with the ultimate closer of Carmel.
Elliott Wilbur - Oppenheimer
Alright, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with UBS.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS
Good morning. A few follow-up questions, first of all just to clarify in terms of guidance. Does your guidance assume that the Florida facility will be fully operational by midyear and then on Protonix. I know you gave some color, but if you can just also relate it to us also how much inventory do you still have?
And lastly on the pricing environment, you can comment on the pricing environment you\'re seeing for the existing book of business. Thank you.
Paul Bisaro
\n', b'
Well
On Protonix and Endos current inventory, first of all I don\'t know what it is, but even if I did, that would not be something we could disclose. So, wouldn\'t be able to do that. And you asked about whether our guidance assumed getting off OAI status in Florida by midyear, and the answer is yes. Our guidance does assume that.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS
And just one follow-up on Protonix, do you assume from what you\'re seeing now that once your inventory will be depleted, that you\'ll get buying back from the Branded?
Paul Bisaro
\n', b'
Well, under our Endo division generally does not distribute Brand products. So, to the extent that Endo will continue to distribute Protonix to its customers, they would need to go to the brand unless there is a change in the environment.
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS
Let me restate the question this guidance include any Protonix in the second half of the year, Generic Protonix?
Paul Bisaro
I don\'t think I can get to that level of specificity with respect to the Endo Distribution business?
Ricky Goldwasser - UBS
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of [Ronnie Gal] with Bernstein.
Ronnie Gal - Bernstein
Couple of questions, the first one is on Lotrel, you seem to have an opportunity to become to be the second to market for trend in the middle of the year -- if you can tell us a little bit about your I guess thinking about launching (inaudible) and second, just a little bit, just a misunderstanding a little bit of legal situation does the launch of Lotrel by Teva give second filer an umbrella here, or is that something that you basically take coming in at your own risk if you decide to do so.
Paul Bisaro
I\'m going to ask David to pick-up on the Lotrel question. David?
David Buchen
Yeah I think you\'re asking whether we would consider launch of risk, is that right? Right now our case is the 30 month stay that would allow us to launch the product at risk that has not expired and it will not expire until there is a decision on patent validity on the Teva case, so we don\'t expect to launch that product at risk.
Ronnie Gal - Bernstein
Okay. And second about Ferrlecit if you have heard anything from the FDA regarded Ferrlecit or that gives you some confidence that the Teva will not able to come in this year?
David Buchen
No risk, no risk. Well, that question assumes a fair number of variables I don\'t whether, yes I\'ve said in the past we have not heard of any generic entrants any time soon for the product. Our guidance does not assume a Generic for 2008, and to the extent in your other question was whether we heard anything from FDA regarding the citizen petitions pending with Ferrlecit and the answer that is no, we\'ve not heard anything.
Ronnie Gal - Bernstein
Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Greene with JPMorgan.
Paul Bisaro
\n', b'
Hi, Adam.
Adam Greene - JPMorgan
Good morning. On the other Generic revenue for Toprol, is that go away completely if and when you launch your own Generic version of Toprol XL, is that in the guidance as well? And then on ANDA, how should we think about gross margins this year I mean last year, around 15% I think was the lowest we\'ve seen in a long, long time, if we expect to see some relief there or what we think of relative to that?
Mark Durand
\n', b'
I\'ll start with the gross margin question on ANDA. ANDA\'s gross margin should remain relatively flat year-over-year and the margins have been running around 14.5%. That\'s pretty much what the number has been for at least the time I\'ve been here at Watson. So, I don\'t think they\'ve been in the 15s.
There was a point in 2006, when the margins did increase dramatically for ANDA, but that was really more of the anomaly of all of the, if you recall back in 2006, sort of the blockbuster year of launches, of a 180 days of exclusivity and ANDA of course received a lot of value from those kinds of activities and I think that\'s why the margins did increase in \'06 versus what we are seeing today. But I think the 14, 14.5 range is where you should be thinking about ANDA.
Adam Greene - JPMorgan
Okay.
Mark Durand
And then you asked about Toprol, and we don\'t intent to disclose the circumstances that\'s running our agreement with Sandoz, so you\'ll have to stay tuned for the answer to that question.
Adam Greene - JPMorgan
And if I could just ask a follow-up on -- you mentioned you settled Cardizem LA recently, when you launched that in April of \'09, should we expect an authorized generic there and I don\'t think anyone else has filed, so is that something that would be an annuity for several years.
Paul Bisaro
I\'m going to have to decline answering that question, due to the confidentiality provisions around our settlement.
Adam Greene - JPMorgan
Okay. And you are not aware if anyone else has filed?
Paul Bisaro
I\'m not aware of anyone else right now.
Adam Greene - JPMorgan
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Swanson with Citi.
Andrew Swanson - Citi
Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions, I guess both sort of relate to relatively sluggish outlook for the US Generics over the course of the next couple of years. First can you just talk a little bit about having acquired ANDA, have you had an opportunity to not only integrate the business from a financial standpoint, but really integrate it with your own Generics businesses, are there opportunities to kind of get creative and drive market share for Watson products through ANDA/
And then secondly, obviously, we\'ve seen a lot of the other US Base Generic companies make ex-US acquisitions over the last 12 to 18 months. Are those markets that are similarly appealing to you, and is that something that you think about as you envision Watson three to five years out? Thanks.
Paul Bisaro
Well, as I think about Watson three to five years out. Yes, I do expect that we\'ll see some expansion of our marketing opportunities to a global environment. We sort of move globally from half way, we\'ve got our manufacturing operations, we\'ve got API, development capabilities in India and China, we got manufacturing in India, we have a bios facility in India.
But we haven\'t extended beyond sort of the US in terms of marketing. And that\'s an area that I think, we have some opportunity. I do anticipate that over the next few years we\'ll, you\'ll see us make some moves and trying to do some geographic expansion.
Your other question was about ANDA, and how we integrated ANDA into our overall operations. ANDA does operate separately from Watson. It is a distribution business, which is fundamentally different than ours. We do sell some Watson products to ANDA, and ANDA does distribute those products, where we have seen probably the most synergy however has been on our Brand side. 
We\'ve been able to use the ANDA distribution capabilities to distribute Trelstar for example, directly to physicians offices to distribute bill and collect from those physicians in clinics. It\'s really help drive value for our brand business, and I think you\'ll continue to see that. They are special pre-distribution company, so they have those capabilities and that\'s where we\'ve seen most sort of direct leverage.
ANDA has to continue to buy products for its Generic distribution operations from our competitors. So, if we have to keep sort of that business in an arms length area, so people will continue to provide ANDA with competitive pricing and that sort of stuff, and we\'ve done that, and ANDA has been helpful in some Generic products, but by and large it\'s -- that we don\'t try to directly influence the ANDA buying decision on any generic.
Andrew Swanson - Citi
Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Krensavage with Raymond James.
Mike Krensavage - Raymond James
Good morning.
Paul Bisaro
Good morning.
Mike Krensavage - Raymond James
You did elude with ANDA that you are there is a bit of conflict as far as having to buy product from competitors. My question is what is the possibility that you would consider divesting ANDA? Thank you.
Paul Bisaro
Well like any of the opportunities that could be presented to Watson, whether any kind of business development opportunities whether were in the acquisition note, or whether some one asked us whether we are interested in divesting any particular asset.
We consider the opportunity. If it made sense strategically for the company, we might do it. But the reality is at the moment, we are happy with the ANDA distribution business, is profit generator. It generates nice revenues and income and thus I mentioned certainly on the Brand side, it has been very helpful. So, there is no median plan to do anything, but again you never say never on any opportunities that could come along.
Mike Krensavage - Raymond James
Thank you.
Patty Eisenhaur
Operator, we\'ll take our last question.
Operator
Your last question comes from the line of Lei Huang with Summer Street Research.
Lei Huang - Summer Street Research
Just a couple of question on your guidance, first can you talk a little bit about your gross margin expectation for the Generic and Brand business, even if you don\'t want to talk about specific numbers, but just how we should look at it relative to \'07?
Mark Durand
Yeah, I can take that. On a GAAP basis for \'08 we are expecting comparable gross margins when you then exclude out the charges related to the facility closures, gross margin should show a modest improvement on a pro forma basis for \'08.
Lei Huang - Summer Street Research
Is that for both units, for the Generic and the Brand?
Mark Durand
It\'s primarily the Generic.
Lei Huang - Summer Street Research
Okay, great. And then, as far as the Takeda product Actos-[Fortamet] combination, does your guidance for \'08 assume any of that income?
Tom Russillo
Because of the complexity associated with that particular situation and the fact that is not our product to sell, our guidance does not include any impact of that product.
Lei Huang - Summer Street Research
Okay. I assume you don\'t know what Takeda\'s plan would be for the product once it\'s improved.
Tom Russillo
That\'s correct.
Lei Huang - Summer Street Research
Okay. And then also relate in your guidance, does your SG&A assumption reflect any sort of sales force expansion in the second half. You talked about higher margin spend associated with that Silodosin launch preparation to anything therefore sales force additions specifically?
Paul Bisaro
\n', b'
No. Our 350 reps, we feel, can achieve the penetration we want to get in the Urology area and we have some covers now in Gynecology, and as I mentioned Endocrinology as well. So, I think we were very pleased with the current four sides. So, we don\'t have any immediate plans to do anything on a sales force expansion front. The marketing spend I was speaking about was preparation for launch.
Lei Huang - Summer Street Research
Right, okay. And then just last question if I may on the guidance going back to your comments earlier about the EPS being first half weighted versus second half and I understand what you said about the other generic revenue relating to the Sandoz deal and that probably goes away at some point.
But the fact that once the OAI is resolved let\'s say by midyear and you should get Prilosec 40 milligram approved, and you\'ll have your own Metoprolol products. Shouldn\'t that more than offset the loss of the other or some of the other generic revenues?
Mark Durand
Well like any other generic company and any of generic business there is a lot of moving parts. There is product that we are expecting additional competition on. There is a decline in overall units and revenue and we\'ve to offset sort of that decline as well as replace other lost revenue opportunity.
So, I wouldn\'t try to extrapolate from one particular situation to another, and say that well shouldn\'t those two things just offset each other. It doesn\'t really work that way. It\'s really broader than that. There are a lot of factors affecting it.
Lei Huang - Summer Street Research
Okay, alright. Thank you.
Patty Eisenhaur
Well, thank you everyone for participating on the call. We look forward to talking with you again soon. Take care.
