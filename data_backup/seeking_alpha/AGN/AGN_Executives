Thank you, Tracy and good morning everyone. I would like to welcome you to Watson\xe2\x80\x99s third quarter earnings conference call.

Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Thank you, Patty and good morning everyone.  Really is a pleasure to be able to report such solid results at my first earnings call at Watson. But before I talk about the results, I thought I would share some my first impressions with you of my first two months here at Watson. My first priority was to travel around and see as many of the sites as I could and meet with as many of the people if I could, to get a sense for what the assets were at Watson. And first and foremost, we have great people here. They are committed to success of the company and providing quality products, without that we would be in serious trouble and the good news is we do have some great folks here.
\n', b'
We have a very sound and generic business with a good portfolio of marketed products, a good generic pipeline and excellent customer service. We also have a growing brand franchise, with a strong nephrology presence and a growing nephrology franchise. And finally we have a solid distribution business, which we are working to maximize the value of that to our, to the Watson community. Of course we have some challenges and I guarantee we will work very hard to overcome them. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything that\xe2\x80\x99s insurmountable. Also as important as that, we have strategic assets in place or we are putting them in place, that will allow us to drive shareholder value for many years to come.
\n', b'
Now before I turn to the quarter results, I would like to just take a second and thank Dr. Chow for his continued support during my transition period. And I look forward to his continued guidance throughout the rest of the year and for many years to come.
\n', b'
Now turning to the results for the quarter, we will focus primarily on sequential results because as opposed to year-over-year comparisons, because the year-over-year comparisons are not terribly relevant due to the Andrx acquisition in late of 2006. Our consolidated revenues for the third quarter were $595 million, down slightly from $603 million we reported in the second quarter. Our GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.31 and our adjusted earnings per share were $0.33.
\n', b'
Todd will provide further details of the items excluded from our adjusted EPS later in the call. Cash flow from operations was $57 million for the quarter and $256 million year-to-date. This consistent operating and free cash flow does allow us to pay down over $250 million of debt obligations through the end of the third quarter. Additionally just in the past week, we prepaid an additional $75 million of debt leaving just $375 million outstanding or literally half, or half of what we initially borrowed under our senior security facility. Just to remind everyone we still have an additional $575 million of outstanding convertible debentures.
\n', b'
Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn to results from the divisions. On the Generic side, Generic segment revenue in the third quarter was $358 million consisting of $326 million in product sales and $31 million in other revenue. Generic revenue is up slightly from last year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Generic revenue in the quarter includes product sales from the launch of our transdermal Fentanyl product that was launched early in the third quarter and Bupropion XL 300 milligram product, which was launched late in the second quarter. Both products are, launches are progressing well and we\'re pleased with the results we\'ve seen so far and we expect them to be important products for us in the fourth quarter as well
\n', b'
Generic other revenue played a significant role in the quarter with the addition of royalties from Sandoz\xe2\x80\x99s sales of our, of Toprol XL. Just to remind everyone, Sandoz launched this product early in the third quarter after we waived our exclusivity for the 50 milligram product and that is included, those are included in our other revenue sections.
\n', b'
Turning now to our brand segment, the third quarter was a $107 million and consisted of $94 million in product sales and $14 million in other revenue. Brand revenue increased 23% for the third quarter of, over the third quarter of 2006 and decreased about 3% sequentially. For the third quarter specialty product sales were $52 million down 3% from the second quarter and nephrology sales came in at $41 million off 4% on sequential basis. Other Brand revenue was $14 million essentially flat compared to the second quarter.
\n', b'
Turning now to our distribution business, the distribution segment was a bit disappointing at a $130 million for the third quarter, down $17 million for the second quarter levels. The decline in distribution revenues is attributable to the reduction in new product flow in the quarter and changes in market dynamics on our key products. As you know our distribution business generates a lot its revenue based on new generic product launches.
\n', b'
Just to illustrate the difficulty we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this year by not having these new product launches. For the first nine months of 2007 and ANDA\xe2\x80\x99s new product revenue was 70% lower than the comparable period a year ago. Overall distribution gross margins were 12.7%, down slightly from the second quarter levels; again new to shipment product mix and lower pricing on certain distributed products, following those distributed products 180 days of exclusivity period expiring. Including now that the cost of goods, as you know we have had a number of initiatives under way for both near term and longer term, to improve our overall cost structure and enhance our operating efficiencies.
\n', b'
In the near term, the sale of our Phoenix, Arizona manufacturing facility had a positive impact on our third quarter, as costs that were unabsorbed in the second quarter were eliminated with the sale. The Phoenix sale and the closure of our Puerto Rico site earlier this year, completes the site rationalization work we had planned for this year and we remain on track to achieve the approximately $30 million in annualized cost savings we originally forecast. Additional improvements in cost of goods are also being realized from enhanced operating efficiencies that are receiving in both our Corona, California and Carmel, New York facilities.
\n', b'
Regarding our Davie, Florida plant, we remain ready for the re-inspection from FDA, but we just felt no wonder they are going to show up. We have, we do expect them any time and the visit of course is a pre-requisite for the listing of the OAI that is, status that the building is currently under. As for our India initiative, we reached a critical milestone in September with our first product approved for manufacture for the US market out of the Goa facility. This essentially clears the way for us to complete our short term plan to transfer approximately a half a dozen products to that site.
\n', b'
Just to remind everybody though that the, any savings from India right now, are not visible and probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be for most of the 2008, as we incur cost over the next few quarters to move products to our Goa facility. But on a longer term we expect to realize in savings.
\n', b'
As I see it, our operations in India provide us not only with efficiencies and scale in cost but also additional flexibility. On the production side, by early next year Goa will be able to produce about a little over a billion tablets and capsules annually for the U.S. market. While this only represents about 10% of our volume, we do expect to see that volume increase over time in India and outside, in addition to that outside of manufacturing our capabilities in EPI, will allow us to work on raw materials earlier that will support hopefully future pattern challenges for us, as well as provide us opportunities for backward integration and lower cost of production.
\n', b'
Additionally we recently purchased a facility to do bio studies in Mumbai and are very excited to get this up and running. This facility will provide us with the flexibility to manage our own bio studies and significantly reduce cost.
\n', b'
Turning next to R&D, in our genetic pipeline we currently have approximately 70 ANDAs on file with the agency and as we see more frequently, the quality of the company\xe2\x80\x99s pipeline is more important than the number of ANDAs on the file or even the overall market opportunity for that product.
\n', b'
For competitive reasons we don\xe2\x80\x99t provide much feasibility on that pipeline but like any supplier to the Genetic market place we do have  a share of commodity products in that pipeline. While we also have a large number of high quality or differentiated products in that pipeline, products that utilize, specialize API, or specific technologies that we have and that not every one else has access it.
\n', b'
Going forward, we will work to balance our pipeline with commodity products that we believe we can be cost competitive on. As well as differentiated products, including patent challenges, which we would give us higher returns.
\n', b'
Turning next to our brand R&D pipeline, I am very excited about this pipeline as we are, as we continue to build this, one of the strongest and broadest urology portfolio\xe2\x80\x99s in the industry. Turning first to silodosin, the product that will be used to treat BPH; we are in the midst to preparing our NDA and our on track to submit it to the FDA in the first quarter of 2008. We are quite excited about the opportunity with silodosin, as it will address the number one issue BPH for patients who seek urologists. Just to remind everyone the BPH market right now is about a$2 billion market place and growing.
\n', b'
Second important product for us in our pipeline is the topical gel formulation for oxybutynin, for overactive bladder. We completed the Phase III program this past quarter and the gel formulation is very elegant, providing strong efficacy in a low volume, with ET application delivery system. It is a topical gel; it bypasses the first, the first pass effect resulting in lower levels of side effects, such as dry mouth and constipation.
\n', b'
Additionally our topical products have shown excellent skin tolerability. We look forward to sharing these results with you in the near future, once the data is fully compiled and analyzed, and we are in the early stages of preparing our NDA and we expect to submit an NDA for the gel product in the second quarter of 2008.
\n', b'
The third product for us is Trelstar(NYSE:
\n', b'
So as you can see we have 3 new urology products there, soon to have 3 new urology products on file with the FDA, silodosin, the oxybutynin gel and the Trelstar(
\n', b'
Todd Joyce \xe2\x80\x93 Vice President, Corporate Controller and Principal Accounting Officer
\n', b'
Thanks Paul. This morning I will provide highlights of our third quarter financial results, consolidated in divisional basis. My comments will focus primarily on our sequential quarter financial performance.
\n', b'
For the third quarter net revenues were $595 million, down slightly from the $603 million reported in the second quarter of this year. Gross profit increased 2.4% in the third quarter to $248 million, compared to $243 million in the second quarter and the consolidated gross margin increased 1.5 percentage points on a sequential quarter basis to 41.7%.
\n', b'
Turning to the divisional performance, third quarter Generic Division revenue was $358 million up $12 million or 3% from the second quarter. This increase was due to higher other revenue, from royalties earned on sales by Sandoz of the Generic to product sales 50 milligram product. This product was launched by Sandoz, early in the third quarter. As a result of higher other revenue Generico\xe2\x80\x99s margin increased 2 percentage points to 41%, compared to 39% in the second quarter. We expect Generic revenues and gross margin for the fourth quarter to remain consistent with third quarter levels.
\n', b'
Moving to the Brand Division, revenue for the third quarter was a $107 million, down slightly from the $111 million reported in the second quarter. Brand gross margin in the third quarter was 79.4%, up 3.6 percentage points from the 75.8% reported in the second quarter. The increase in Brand gross margin was a result of lower manufacturing cost, primarily as a result of the sale for Phoenix manufacturing plant and a favorable product mix.
\n', b'
For the fourth quarter we expect Brand product sales in other revenue to be roughly flat with third quarter levels. Gross margin is expected to decline slightly to approximately 77%. Finally third quarter revenue in our distribution division was a $130 million, down $17 million or 11% on a sequential quarter basis. This decline was primarily due to a lack of new product launches during the quarter. Distribution of gross margin was 12.7%, a decline if 3.2 percentage points from the second quarter. For the fourth quarter distribution revenues are expected to remain flat with third quarter levels. We expect distribution gross margin to improve slightly in the fourth quarter to roughly 14%.
\n', b'
Turning now to our operating expenses, our NDA, our R&D spending for the third quarter was $36 million, flat with the second quarter. SG&A for the quarter was a $112 million, an increase of $15 million from the second quarter. The increase was due to $8.5 million of litigation charges and $4.5 million in severance charges incurred in the quarter.
\n', b'
Our third quarter GAAP earnings also include the $10.6 million gain from the sale of our Phoenix Manufacturing Plant and a $4.5 million impairment charge, due to a decline in market value for our Puerto Rico Plant, which is currently being held for sale. Amortization for the third quarter was $44.2 million. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.31 per share, down from $0.33 per share in the second quarter. On an adjusted basis, excluding litigation, impairment and acquisition related charges and the gain on the sale of the Phoenix facility, Watson third quarter adjusted net income was $37.2 million or $0.33 per share. Adjusted EPS in the second quarter was $0.34 per share.
\n', b'
Turning briefly to the balance sheet and cash flow, at September 30, cash in marketable securities was a $145 million. Our long term debt was just under $1 billion and our debt to capitalization ratio was 35%. In the current quarter, we had prepaid an additional $75 million of debt leaving just $325 million outstanding under our senior credit facility and $575 million of outstanding convertible debt. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $56.5 million. Our operating cash flow was impacted by a reduction in current liabilities arising from higher second quarter inventory purchases. The decline in accounts payable was offset in part, by reductions in both accounts receivable and inventory during the quarter. On a year-to-date basis our cash flow from operations was a $256 million. Adjusted EBITDA after the third quarter was a $135 million, essentially flat with the second quarter. With that I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn the call back over to Paul for additional comments on the full year forecast and some concluding remarks.
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President and Chief Executive Officer
\n', b'
Thanks Todd. Before we move to questions I just want to quickly go over guidance for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter we expect consolidated revenue and gross margins to be fairly consistent with third quarter levels. For a full year we continue to believe our total revenue will come in at about $2.5 billion and our guidance for our generic segment revenues remains unchanged approximately $1.5 billion.
\n', b'
Our previous forecast for the Brand segment revenue was $400 million to $420 million, based on the division here-to-date performance we are raising guidance on the brand revenue side to 420, between $420 million and $430 million. Our previous forecast for the distribution division was $575 million to $615 million. Again based on the performance to date, we are lowering our full year forecast to between $550 million and $565 million. On a GAAP and an adjusted basis we expect fourth quarter R&D spending to increase, for both our generic and brand divisions. As a result of this increase in R&D, we do expect a slight decline, $0.02 to $0.03 decline in the fourth quarter, GAAP and adjusted EPS from the third quarter. Nevertheless for the full year we are moving up our adjusted EPS forecast to $1.30 to $1.33 from the $1.25 to $1.30 that we had last quarter. Our full year adjusted EPS estimate, excludes a number of charges of course and those are detailed in our earnings release. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $536 million and $541 million. As you can see, we had a solid third quarter with a number of very positive initiatives under way. We will continue very hard to work on those initiatives and I look forward to continued success in the fourth quarter. Patty?

Question and Answer
\n', b'
Operator
\n', b'
[Operator Instructions]. We will for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Greg Gilbert with Merrill Lynch.
\n', b'
Gregory Gilbert - Merrill Lynch
\n', b'
Thanks good morning. I have a couple of quick ones. Paul, first on the distribution business, can you describe the dynamic that have been negatively effecting that business for several quarters now. And also comment on how the AMP role could affect that business. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve a follow up.
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Okay. Let me start and then I will turn it over to Allen, to see if he has anything further to add. I think the biggest issue affecting the business right now is the lack of sort of large generic product launches, sort of the fact industry like. I think, we still\xe2\x80\xa6 I mentioned our revenue from new product launches is down 70% year-over-year. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s really the big driver. Regarding AMP, I think AMP is sort of yet to be determined.  We still wait t see what will happen with the AMP legislation where\xe2\x80\x99s working with. The GPHA to try to get sort of weighted average AMP and hopefully one that isn\xe2\x80\x99t published and if it is, it is the weighted average and not specific AMP. Well, Al do you have anything to add.
\n', b'
Albert Paonessa \xe2\x80\x93 Executive Vice President; Chief Operating Officer of Anda, Inc.
\n', b'
Yes, I could add a couple of comments to the new launches. We are considerably down and even what we assumed would come out, throughout the year or 50% below what we assumed would come out. Just in the third quarter alone versus third quarter last year, we only did 10% of the sales volume that we did last year in new launches. So its affected us considerably and our numbers are showing that.
\n', b'
Gregory Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Merrill Lynch
\n', b'
So no competitive issues in that business, just really industry launches?
\n', b'
Albert Paonessa \xe2\x80\x93 Executive Vice President; Chief Operating Officer of Anda, Inc.
\n', b'
Yes, my business, I look at another part of our business right? I view orders lines in units and customer account and are were pretty consistent year-over-year. So most of it is the new launches that have not materialized this year that we were hoping for. We will never see a banner year, like we did last year. But it was quite down compared to this year, what happen when we thought we would do in new launches year-to-date.
\n', b'
Gregory Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Merrill Lynch
\n', b'
All right one more and I will get back in line Paul. I know you haven\xe2\x80\x99t provided. I know Watson hasn\xe2\x80\x99t provided longer term guidance. But how and when do you expect either generic versions of Fralacitor [ph] other branded products to affect your iron business, given the relative importance to that product line. Thanks.
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Well, right now I am at [inaudible], as you know we have not heard about any generic competition coming anytime soon, we have citizens petitions for the product, I think, we\'re comfortable with citizens petitions for the product. I think we\'re comfortable, we wont see anything for the fourth quarter. But going beyond that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t given guidance for 2008. We plan to give guidance in, for 2008 when we give our year-end results. But Greg right now we don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything on the horizon for Lased [ph] from a generic perspective
\n', b'
Gregory Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Merrill Lynch

Your next question comes from Randall Stanicky with Goldman Sachs.
\n', b'
Randall Stanicky \xe2\x80\x93 Goldman Sachs
\n', b'
Great. Thanks very much for the Question Paul. You came from a business, from a company that was pursuing both, high barrier portfolio strategy and also international expansion plan at the time and obviously you put a big part in that. Now that you are at Watson and now that you have had some time to review both the pipeline and the strategic outlook from here. Can you just maybe talk about pipeline strategy in terms of what type of products you are going to go after? Should we expect a change there? And then do you think Watson\xe2\x80\x99s global footprint in terms of some of the ex-U.S. activity is sufficient or do you think you\'re more aggressive on that front? Thanks.
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Thanks Randall. On the pipeline front we have a, we here at Watson have a slightly different set of assets than the assets that were at the company I came from. And so we\'re going to presume probably a more balanced strategy on the Generics side. Looking for certain commodity products as I mentioned that I think that we can be competitive on we do have API capabilities, we have large volume API capabilities. We also have low cost of production in India and in some cases even China.
\n', b'
So we\'re going to try to balance that portfolio but we will also try to be more aggressive on differentiated products. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see more challenges from us over the next few quarters and years and trying to, trying to drive additional value sort of from a balanced approach on the portfolio. Regarding geographic expansion, I think our first step on the geographic side will be to take some of the assets that we have and look to some markets that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t historically tried to penetrate. A lot of that activity will probably be out licensed or with third party partners in those countries, but if we got the right opportunity to expand our geographic footprint, we would certainly look at it and if it was the right thing for Watson to do we would move on it. I do think in the next five years you will see us move outside of the U.S. though.
\n', b'
Randall Stanicky \xe2\x80\x93 Goldman Sachs
\n', b'
It\xe2\x80\x99s sort of on that topic as a follow up maybe to Greg\xe2\x80\x99s question. Thinking a little bit longer-term and one of the things that Watson\xe2\x80\x99s had or too good to find out, that having a lot of gross margin on the generic business, it, now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through. Is that something that you see, looking on maybe two to three years, do you see that moving more towards an industry norm? Or I mean is there the infrastructure costs opportunity there to drive those margins higher at least into the mid to higher 40\xe2\x80\x99s over the next several years.
\n', b'
Albert Paonessa \xe2\x80\x93 Executive Vice President; Chief Operating Officer of Anda, Inc.
\n', b'
Well of course some of our generic margins are affected by our AG\xe2\x80\x99s and we will continue to pursue an AG strategy where appropriate. But the new product launches should drive our margins up and I would like to see our margins go up over time and with new product launches exit from our existing pipeline as well as the stuff we are working on we hope to become more in line with the industry as you mentioned.

Your next question comes from Elliot Wilbur with CIBC World markets.
\n', b'
Elliot Wilbur \xe2\x80\x93 CIBC World Markets
\n', b'
Good morning. Several questions. The first is, are you aware of any change in data, so you can guide us with an update on your partner\xe2\x80\x99 [inaudible] pending application for Lovenox Momentos [ph] out this morning, saying that they received a non-approvable letter for their application and they believe that this requirements put forth body FDA able applied to all ANDA applicants. And just wondering if there is any change in status here that you guys are aware of?
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Well, Elliot, we read at the same time you did. We have not heard from our partner this morning. They are of course on the west coast, we have to call them and we will hear, and if we hear anything we will certainly let everybody know. But right now we are just evaluating the release that we saw and we will react to it once we talk to our partner.
\n', b'
Elliot Wilbur \xe2\x80\x93 CIBC World Markets
\n', b'
Okay thanks and then a follow up question perhaps for Al on the distribution business. I understand that the, perhaps the majority of the softness is attributed to the absence of expecting your product launches. But can you maybe just provide us with a little commentary to whether or not there has been any discernable change in terms of the overall of pricing erosion on the base business?
\n', b'
Albert Paonessa \xe2\x80\x93 Executive Vice President; Chief Operating Officer of Anda, Inc.
\n', b'
Well, the pricing erosion has been credible actually, up 10 points from the previous year. Mainly due to the 180 day exclusivities. We have seen products drop 97% in one day. So it\xe2\x80\x99s the largest erosion we have had in any previous year, so it is affecting us there. Yet competitive lies again, our customer base and our orders that we do each day and the average order amount, et cetera has been consistent even in this type of erosion. So and it is very competitive as you can also see with our margins. So yes, our base business, our orders in lines in units are up so we are selling more products than I have ever sold before, its just the price of those products obviously are down substantially.
\n', b'
Elliot Wilbur \xe2\x80\x93 CIBC World Markets

Okay thanks and one last question here. Just with respect to the recent launch of transdermal Fetnal [ph], maybe you can just give us a little bit of color on the market dynamics there and has the uptake been what you expected, was there sort of an average level of inventory or below average level of inventory and the channel at the time that you launched and maybe just give us a little bit of a color on the pricing dynamics there. Thank you.
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Well, I think it is, remember transdermal Fetnal [ph] is a scheduled 2 product and that in itself takes, makes the uptake a little bit slower, you got to get to 2 forms and it\xe2\x80\x99s got to get through the distribution channel. But I think we did see in this particular instance of bit more inventory in the channels than we expected and so the update has been a little bit slower as customers work through the inventory that they have from the existing players. But we do expect to see that trying to turn around and for us to get a fair amount of the, our fair share I guess of the business.
\n', b'
As the pricing, we don\xe2\x80\x99t really comment on specific pricing but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that this product it\xe2\x80\x99s not a commodity Generic.  So we are pretty pleased with where we are right now.

Good morning, just 2 questions, one if you could give us an update on the Andrx manufacturing and also if you could give us an update on your low trial litigation and then give us a timing of your 30 months stay and then the update on how that litigation is progressing? Thanks.
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Okay I will do the Andrx and I may have to turn it over to our General council for the low trial litigation, since I haven\xe2\x80\x99t memorized the litigation yet here at Watson. But on the Andrx, the Andrx piece as I mentioned we are waiting for the SPA to come in to do the inspection, we have invited them in. Of course they chose when they want to show up. We have not seen them yet; we will try to keep people posted on that.
\n', b'
We do anticipate, by the way we have no impact of the OAH status being listed in the fourth quarter so from the fourth quarter prospective we just hope to have the inspection performed in the office early as possible.

\n', b'
David A. Buchen \xe2\x80\x93 Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Secretary
\n', b'
The trail litigation, the case has stayed, right now pending the outcome of the teller [ph] litigation. And as far as the 30 months stay, based on the agreement 3 other parties related to the stay, the 30 months stay is also tied to a decision of the Tevva [ph] case.
\n', b'
Ken Cacciatore \xe2\x80\x93 Cowen and Company
\n', b'
Can you give me a little more explanation, so if the Tevva [ph] case resolved, then your 3 months stay is lifted?
\n', b'
David A. Buchen \xe2\x80\x93 Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Secretary
\n', b'
Yes, Tevva [ph] case, clients\xe2\x80\x99 patents are invalid and they have been successful in validating that and the 30 months stay will expire.

Ken Cacciatore \xe2\x80\x93 Cowen and Company

What if they are only successful in proving on [inaudible]?

Hi thanks Paul, I had a question about the oral contraceptive business at Watson. You came from a company in Barr that took a lot of share from Watson over the years. Is that business, still a growing business at Watson? Do you expect it to grow over the next couple of years? If you will just give us a little flavor on that.
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Sure Tim. On the OC front, we have about; here at Watson we have about an equal share of market with Barr. I think we flip flopped back and forth this\xe2\x80\xa6 between 30% and 31% and sort of depending on the quarter who has the most share. As with any market of likeness the products are starting to age a bit and so units are declining, in some cases prices are declining and there\xe2\x80\x99s new launches, the new launches that are coming out we are sort of replacing all of that dip as quickly as we like. However there are some new products, we launched the Generic version of Estra Step [ph] we just recently. And we do have some new launches in the category coming so we believe here, that we will continue to see our OC franchise continue to be an important contributor to us, not just through the rest of this year but into 2008. And we don\xe2\x80\x99t see any sort of major change on the horizon, except for the possibility of at some point in 2008 some additional competition in, on some of the products.

Well I think where everyone is aware that Teva did acquire some of the assets that had to be divested by us, when we acquired Andrx and so we are not quite sure when Teva is going to appear with those assets, but when they do, they would obviously present a challenge on some of those products.

\n', b'
Marc Goodman \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse
\n', b'
Couple of things, Paul, First of all can you talk about what your priorities are relative to the three different businesses, talk about just business development, which was always something that Barr seemed to be pretty good at and doing quite a bit of deals that just seemed like, is that something that you are looking to do more of. Second question is on the site transfer, I thought I heard you say that six products were looking to be transferred. Was that early FY08 or by the end of FY08? That seems to be a little bit slower than what we thought before maybe you can put it in context of, okay here\xe2\x80\x99s what we can expect for the next year but over the three years we expect how many products will be transferred. And when will be start to see the savings on the bottom line from that asset?
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Okay well let me see if I can address them in sequence. Your first comment Mark was, what do I see about the positives of each of the groups and I think you asked me that in terms of, in sort of the business development effort. Regarding business development from a generic perspective we will continue to be opportunistic. Where we are presented with opportunities for partnerships with companies to sell Generic products that we don\xe2\x80\x99t currently have we will continue to pursue those. If there is API or specific development opportunities that we think are valuable we will continue to pursue those as well. On the brand side I think our challenge would lead to, we sort of have good news and bad news. The good news is we are really filing three great NDAs in 2008; the bad news is we got to reload our pipeline. So we are going to work on that challenge for 2008.
\n', b'
And on the distribution business we are going to continue to try to use it to help us in some of the distribution challenges that we have in addition help grow that business, but also in some of the distribution challenges we have, we have a brand product that ANDA now distributes to us, for us directly to physicians\xe2\x80\x99 offices. It was a great opportunity for both, for Watson and the distribution division to see some value, complementary value really from having the distribution as part of our organization.
\n', b'
Marc Goodman \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse
\n', b'
Let me ask you before you go on that from the Generic side should we expect you to start to move into other types of doses, things like that?
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Yes as a matter of fact we have, we do have a lot of assets here that are available to Watson that really weren\xe2\x80\x99t available at Barr. For example we have patch capability, we have gel production capability, you can see us moving in more aggressively into those areas and we will continue to look for unique dosage form delivery capability. With the Andrx facility we have certainly a significant delayed release capability; we will continue to work on products that have those attributes.
\n', b'
Regarding the site transfers we have approximately 5 products that are in the process of being transferred, some have, in fact almost all of them have been filed, the transfer documentations have been filed with the agency. We do expect to start producing product out of the India facility for the U.S. market early in 2008. However we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate seeing any major cost reduction till the end of, or even any cost reduction for that matter until sort of the end of 2008 and into 2009.
\n', b'
Marc Goodman \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse
\n', b'
And what kind of movement of product should we be expecting, basically over a three year period?
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Well I think what we are going to try to do is look for products that are, very price sensitive to move to our India operation, where we can take advantage of the lower cost of production to the extent that we are tend backward integrate. With the API we will do that and we will look to use our U.S. facilities to handle the higher cost or the higher value Generic products, because they can support the higher cost of production.

\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Well I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer the first question first. I have not actively participated and won\xe2\x80\x99t actively participate in products that there is a conflict or potential conflict between Watson and Barr. So to that extent that was a commitment I made to Barr and I will honor that and Watson has agreed so that\xe2\x80\x99s no problem. As to seasonality, I do, I am aware that generally we continue to sell our products and there has been no change in the matter at this time. So we continue to sort of wait and see what the next steps are from Barr.
\n', b'
Adam Greene \xe2\x80\x93 JP Morgan
\n', b'
Okay and if I could also sneak in a follow up question just on, certain settlements might get your view on where you stand on settlements you have Cortizone LA trial starting next week and a number of other P4s are coming up so just like to hear what your stance on that?
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Well I believe structured properly, settlements are entirely lawful and pro competitive and so I am certainly not adverse to settlements, I also recognize that you can\xe2\x80\x99t always achieve a settlement with somebody that you are in litigation with. So we will follow a tried and true strategy of working toward a, winning a trial and if an opportunity presents itself that is reasonable and pro competitive to settle the matter we will do that.

Can you give us a better sense of what the forum for that disclosure would be and little bit better idea of the time frame? And second question is on the other brand revenues and the sequential increase that we saw, can you give us a sense of, how much of that and if, whether the majority of that was Toprol XL 50 milligram or were there other items as well?

Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director

Let me address the first question, you said other brand revenues there I think you\xe2\x80\x99re, are you speaking about other generic revenues because you ask about shortfall.

\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director

Yes, I mean certainly there are other components to other revenues; the major contributor to the increase though was Toprol. As to your question about oxycodone [ph], I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask Heimers to address that.
\n', b'
Edward F. Heimers \xe2\x80\x93 Executive Vice President, President of Brand Division

So very robust Phase III clinical program and as I say sometime before year end we will actually be indicating how the products backs up. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say preliminarily it is the demonstrably superior to the patch on all the safety side affectations.
\n', b'
Richard Silver \xe2\x80\x93 Lehman Brothers

Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director

As to Actic [ph] we don\xe2\x80\x99t, have not heard about any additional competition [inaudible] address it. But right now we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard about any additional competition.

I think you mentioned you are bound by the Prevacid [ph] am I to understand that you cannot launch address, when you 30 months stay, until if the case is not resolved. I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s question one. And the second was the new density ever raised that you could remind us regarding Fairlicit [ph] in your citizen\xe2\x80\x99s petition regarding this product.

David A. Buchen \xe2\x80\x93 Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Secretary
\n', b'
Yes, the case is currently stayed and if the Tevic [ph] decision comes out invalidating the pact, the 30 months stay would be listed. We cannot launch a risk unless we got back into litigation on the case, active litigation. If the Tevic [ph] case does not resolve in the patent being invalidated.
\n', b'
Landy Gal \xe2\x80\x93 Bearn Steins

So thanks to you,.you cannot wait where you are until the Tevic [ph] case gets resolved?

I think on the Frulessi [pf], what I would say there is, I think our citizens petition is focused on adequately characterizing the raw material and the process by which the product was made and I think we would leave it at that and not comment much further about our citizens\xe2\x80\x99 petitions.
\n', b'
Landy Gal \xe2\x80\x93 Bearn Steins

Great. And just a quick follow up. Regarding the distribution business, now that you\'ve been in the company for a couple of months. How do you think about this business? Is this still a strategic asset for the company? Something that you believe the company significantly benefits from? Or something that on an appropriate time given the appropriate price that will be something that it will be, no longer be part of Watson?
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Well I think certainly I see it as a strategic asset. I think our challenge is to help this asset continue to grow, and we look at a lot of opportunities with all of our assets and from time to time. But here I think this particular asset has given us as I mentioned some unique opportunities to not only distribute products, to distribute products on the Brand side and before we make any major changes in the organization, we have to understand how that would impact our existing business on the Brand side as well as the generic side. So, we, I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s a strategic asset; we have no plans to do anything with it except just try to help it grow.

Ricky Goldwasser \xe2\x80\x93 UBS
\n', b'
Good morning, Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of questions. For the drug distribution segment you talked really about the more of chart year-to-year comparison as impacting the business. So when we think about the business going forward and into FY08, should we assume these comparisons anniversary, second quarter and that\xe2\x80\x99s when you should stop start growing the business. And then an additional follow-up, in prior quarters you talked about specific products that are included in guidance. Just to clarify, have all these products that have materializes are now part of the Watson portfolio and if not what\xe2\x80\x98s still outstanding between now and the end of the year?
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Well I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer the first question first or the last question first I guess? As to, we have launched basically every product that we anticipated launching in 2007. There may be a couple of more launches late in the year but nothing that would, we think materially move the needle. Regarding the distribution business, I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not possible to answer that question at this time. We do have to see kind of what 2008 looks like from an industry perspective and see what products we think are going to launch industry wide whether they are Watson or any other company. To see what the impact will be on our distribution business. So I think you know we will continue work hard to grow that business as I mentioned, but I am not sure we can extrapolate any one particular quarter into 2008.
\n', b'
Ricky Goldwasser \xe2\x80\x93 UBS
\n', b'
Just to understand how you can if you look at the product pipeline, are in terms like, just looking at what are the scheduled pattern expirations and how does that compare to what we have seen in FY07 or are you using other metric where you are saying is less predictable?
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
Well I think on the distribution business, here we are speaking specifically about the distribution business\xe2\x80\x94
\n', b'
Ricky Goldwasser \xe2\x80\x93 UBS
\n', b'
Correct.
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
I think there is certainly a component of products that we know are going off pattern and those products are going to launch, where it\xe2\x80\x99s harder to predict and perhaps, the products have actually generated more value for the distribution business is when, products are launched with 180 days of exclusivity or are launch at risk by Generic companies, Watson or otherwise. I think and it does better with those products. So those products are not easy to predict, but you have to assume that something will happen in 2008, we may not know which particular product but you have to assume that something will happen.
\n', b'
So it is a challenge to try to predict and forecast what the revenues will be, instead of when they will hit in the distribution business. Al is that consistent with your--
\n', b'
Albert Paonessa \xe2\x80\x93 Executive Vice President; Chief Operating Officer of Anda, Inc.
\n', b'
That\xe2\x80\x99s there I mean we are looking at next year being a normal launch year of new products, nothing like we saw in FY06, but again we thought this year would, we are 50% down of what we estimated this year will be. So again we can\xe2\x80\x99t even go quarter for quarter, but we do see that, we do think it will be normal launch here and obviously better than this year.
\n', b'
Ricky Goldwasser \xe2\x80\x93 UBS
\n', b'
When you said [inaudible] derivative, you think that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like about 50%, the products coming out with 50% below would, you assume that come out, given your comments now, we should think more about than about 180 and the products that are at risk launches. Can you kind of like share with us what products you actually expected will come into the market and didn\xe2\x80\x99t?

\n', b'
Lee Hong \xe2\x80\x93 Summer Streaks Breezer
\n', b'
Hi, thanks, few questions and some of those, now that you have a NDA preparation underway and you have a filing in 1Q, can you just talk about thoughts on commercialization as far as potential partnership. Second question is on the guidance, your fourth Q guidance for the brand margin looks like it\xe2\x80\x99ll be down 240 basis points from third quarter reported margin. What\xe2\x80\x99s the difficulty there is I guess driving the third quarter margin higher or driving fourth quarter margin lower and actually if I can sneak in one more as far as the company\xe2\x80\x99s efforts in India could there be any tax implications longer term, i.e. if you have more bio studies and more products being developed there, does that have any benefit for your tax rate going forward. Thanks.
\n', b'
Paul M. Bisaro \xe2\x80\x93 President, Chief Executive Officer, Director
\n', b'
I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer the last question first, again. On the India tax rate I don\'t believe we will see much if any tax benefit for producing product in India. What we will see is, particularly in bio studies there we see the lower cost performance studies, which will allow us to do more with the same amount of dollars on [inaudible] deep front. I think the next question sort of going backwards was the question on the margin strategy. Do you want to\xe2\x80\xa6?
\n', b'
David A. Buchen \xe2\x80\x93 Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Secretary
\n', b'
Sure the margins were impacted by a favorable product mix in the third quarter then we\xe2\x80\x99ll see more a normal product mix in the fourth quarter and that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons for the decline and also some one time benefits from the plant enclosure also impacted the brand margins in the third quarter.

We are, we will consider in them and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in the past the possibility of looking to partner with someone to try to reach a broader, the GP audience with this product but no final decisions have been made either as to partner or who the partner might be.

As we prepared for a 2008 budget, as a group our manufacturing team is looking at what products might make sense to put in the Andrx facility but at the end of Andrx facilities. But as to our pipeline that comes out of there certainly, getting off the LOI status that something that will unleash a number of products for that facility. We are very keen and making sure that we get that behind us as quickly as possible to do that and our team, our R&D team in Florida is working very diligently to file as many products as they possibly can to help to fill up that capacity. We are sort of looking at capacity corporate right now and we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably have more guidance on that in 2008.

I guess just a follow-up on that is there any ability to site transfers or have you looked at those, for some of these key products in FY08 and have them produced perhaps outside of Davy, Florida?

Well yes, there is certainly the possibility to do site transfers into that location, we do a lot of third party, we have a number of parties, third parties making product for us. We may look to move some of that production in house over an extended period of time. There is a number of initiatives to try the, to try to find additional capacity for the Davy plant.

Okay just an easy one, on the sales gross margin, if I look at just product sales, it looks like its about 35.3 for the third quarter, up versus year ago by 300 basis points I guess because of the AGs going down but, is that a good number? Or do you expect for the fourth quarter increased product sales gross margin?

I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonable number. Maybe slightly higher for the fourth quarter.
