Our next presentation is going to be by American Electric Power. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got Brian Tierney, Executive Vice President and CFO to take us through the AEP story. Brian?
Brian Tierney
Thank you, Dan. Appreciate you all being here today. I\xe2\x80\x99m thrilled to be here and we\xe2\x80\x99d like to take you through some discussion. Obviously we have the Safe Harbor statements that you need to be aware of. Please read that at your leisure and make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re all compliant.
So for those of you who don\xe2\x80\x99t know, to take you through very quickly, we are a utility holding company in the middle part of the United States. We operate in 11 states. We have 5.3 million customers, almost $15 billion in revenue last year, about $1.3 billion in net income. Market cap was about $21 billion and solid BBB/Baa2 corporate credit rating. So large, mostly regulated utility company. 
About 85% of our assets and income are regulated. We\xe2\x80\x99re focused very much on clarity of the story and execution. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get into some detail a little bit later. But a lot of what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is focused on corporate separation of our Ohio GENCO assets from our Ohio Integrated Utility, getting that out and separated and getting up and running, where we have a very straightforward asset allocation story, capital going to work in our regulated enterprises, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s our TRANSCOS or wireless only companies or integrated utilities and then focusing on making our GENCO as competitive as possible in the markets that we\xe2\x80\x99re operating in.
Very much of a capital allocation and discipline around cost story. It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we have a very strong track record on recently and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to share that with you in the coming slides. Something we\xe2\x80\x99ll get on very quickly is the fact that throughout much of our utility operations, we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with very stable regulation utility commissioners that are not politicized, that are focused on the long term public policy implications of the decisions they make and trying to attract capital to the states where they regulate it. 
We do have a fair amount of peace and tranquility across our utility operating jurisdictions and we\xe2\x80\x99re at a point now where we\xe2\x80\x99re putting some of the Ohio uncertainty that has been a difficulty around our story very well behind us, having all the necessary orders from the state of Ohio to effect that corporate separation that we need. We will talk about what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done with our cost structure going forward. We\xe2\x80\x99ll look at what the CAGR has been over the last several years, how we\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on decreasing our base utility O&M and how we have plans to continue those efforts as we move forward.
And so the Ohio generation fleet is going to be positioned for success. Chuck Zebula and Mark McCullough and their teams are focused on making those assets competitive under just about any market conditions that we could see. And then a significant part of our story and we\xe2\x80\x99ll spend a fair amount of time on this, is what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at in terms of our transmission growth opportunities. That\xe2\x80\x99s a part of the business where Lisa Barton and her team are focused on projects that are known to us, projects that either don\xe2\x80\x99t need incremental approval or already have the approval that they need and they\xe2\x80\x99re putting that capital to work for the benefit of our customers, for the benefit of reliability on the system and certainly making sure that they are availing themselves of the incentives that are out there to put dollars to work in transmission space.
We\xe2\x80\x99ve organized our businesses better than anyone else to put the dollars to work to show transparency and clarity of sight in terms of where we\xe2\x80\x99re putting the dollars to work, how we\xe2\x80\x99re getting the benefits for our customers and how we\xe2\x80\x99re improving reliability and at the same time able to grow earnings in a very transparent way by doing that. 
Finally, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that we have a very strong balance sheet. We have opportunities to securitize some deferrals, those moving very well in Ohio and West Virginia in particular and we\xe2\x80\x99re able to bring incremental dollars in the door. From where we stand today, we\xe2\x80\x99re not looking at any incremental equities required for the CapEx that we have planned for the next several years and don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate incremental equity behind our dividend reinvestment program. So we\xe2\x80\x99re operating today from a very, very strong standpoint in terms of balance sheet and credit metrics and we\xe2\x80\x99ll also look at that in a little more detail.
We\xe2\x80\x99d like to look at some of the pro forma ROEs that we have. This is what my boss Nick Akins calls a synthesizer slide because he is a musician. It shows what our earned ROEs for the trailing 12 months have been across our major regulatory jurisdictions. Overall, on a blended basis it\xe2\x80\x99s a 10.2% ROE which was the average of what authorize ROEs were for last year across utilities in the United States. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see a couple of these are lagging. We have plans in place to address where these are lagging and we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide some more detail on that later as we go forward.
Let me specifically address Indiana which is in front of you, where we had a positive rate case in February that was ordered with a 102% ROE. One of the things that was effective in that was a lack of a forward-looking test year. So legislation was passed in Indiana that allows for a forward-looking test year and allows for a reduction in the lag that has historically been a problem in the state of Indiana. 
So, two things are going to happen here. One is we work our way through a full 12 months at the higher authorized return. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see that 7.5% continue to creep up and then at some point in the future, Paul Chodak and his team will look at when is the right time for us to go back into Indiana and avail ourselves of the new legislation that they have. 
On the SWEPCO side, again getting a little bit ahead of myself, a large part of that lag is associated with getting Turk into rates across all the jurisdictions that SWEPCO covers. And we were getting news out of Texas even today that the Public Utility Commission of Texas is finding that the investment in Turk is prudent, that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to authorize a 9.65% ROE that environmental consumables will be allowed to be passed through and fuel and that some of the settlements that we entered into with some of the interveners in that case will be allowed for recovery. So all in all, I think some positive developments out of Texas today that will allow us to continue to improve SWEPCO\xe2\x80\x99s ROE.
Over at APCO, Charles Patton and his team have been steadily moving the ROE up there. And as we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about later, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be in for a rate case early next year to begin availing themselves of the biannual Virginia rate case to try and address that as well. So the places where we\xe2\x80\x99re earning strong, we certainly deserve it through the actions that we put in place and the plans that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made and the customer shares that we had and the places where we\xe2\x80\x99re lagging we have plans in place to improve those and are well in our way in making those plans happen.
One of the things that we talk about is our disciplined focus on CapEx and where we\xe2\x80\x99re putting our dollars to work. Our 4% to 6% earnings per share growth rate, which we\xe2\x80\x99re reaffirming is predicated on our ability to put capital to work in our regulated properties, get that reflected in rates and put the dollars to work for the benefit of our customers and put the earnings back in the pockets of our shareholders. From 2012 our net regulated PP&E was almost $34 billion and between \xe2\x80\x9913 and \xe2\x80\x9915 we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a 6.9% compound annual growth rate in the CapEx we\xe2\x80\x99re putting to work in those businesses.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at where those dollars are being put to work. Vertically integrated utilities are going to capture $4.4 billion of that $7.5 billion. The wires only companies which will be in Texas and Ohio are going to attract $1 billion of that capital spend. Our ROEs in those jurisdictions will be between 9.6% and 11%. And then the TRANSCO Transource will attract $2.1 billion of the $7.5 billion. And those authorized ROEs will be between 11.2% and $11.49% with the blended rate on Transource being 11.1%. So it\xe2\x80\x99s predicated on the dollars being put to work in the regulated part of our businesses, compound annual growth rate of investments 6.9%, some lag in that allowing us to get the earnings per share growth rate of 4% to 6% over time.
As we\xe2\x80\x99re putting the dollars to work, you saw that a fair amount of that investment, a fair amount of the $7.5 billion was going to transmission. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk a little bit about the TRANSCO opportunities and how that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be growing our earnings over time. In 2010 we had invested a total of $50 million in the TRANSCO properties that we talked about. Between 2010 and 2015 we anticipate having invested $2.8 billion in that business, compound annual growth rate of 124%.
At the end of last year we had $700 million invested in the TRANSCO business. We anticipate doubling that this year and we anticipate bringing that up to $2.8 billion by 2015. What does that mean in terms of earnings per share growth over that timeframe? Also pretty significant growth in earnings per share. $0.09 last year, anticipated to be $0.014 per share this year, more than doubling next year to $0.29 per share estimated and anticipating bringing that up to $0.36 per share by 2015. Obviously a strong growth opportunity for us. 
Lisa Barton has organized our businesses to take advantage of the opportunities that we have in our system for the benefit of our customers and those passing through our system I think better than anyone in the industry has. We are putting the dollars to work. We are filing for the formula based rates. We\xe2\x80\x99re availing ourselves to be attractive ROEs. We don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we\xe2\x80\x99re at risk the way some of the others are for having unjust and unreasonable rates. We think our rates are quite just and reasonable at 11.2% and 11.49% for our TRANSCOS in SPP and PGM respectively.
What are the attractive components of this business to us? One is TRANSCOS and Transource are regulated by FERC and FERC is very much in sending utilities to put dollars to work in the transmission business. Secondly, the revenue requirement is formula based where it\xe2\x80\x99s reset annually based on the prior years\xe2\x80\x99 activity plus a true-up for what\xe2\x80\x99s anticipated for next year, for the current year and then what\xe2\x80\x99s anticipated for next year, significantly reducing the regulatory lag for the dollars that we invest in this space. The ROEs that we talked about, very attractive. 
And finally, Transource is a significant opportunity. That\xe2\x80\x99s where we own 86% of it in the weighted average ROE is 11.1%. The investment there begins in 2014 as Great Plains gets the projects transferred over from their regulated businesses into the Transource ownership.
A significant component that we like to talk about and it\xe2\x80\x99s important to both our customers and our investors is what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to do on the O&M side of the equation, how we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to reduce O&M from 2010 to 2013. We separate O&M out into two components. One is base and the other that is items with earnings offsets that has trackers. We focus from an investor standpoint on the base utility O&M that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to decrease from $2.8 billion in 2010 to estimated $.26 billion in 2006. 
The CAGR on that has been negative 2.9%. That\xe2\x80\x99s good for our customers in that we\xe2\x80\x99re being more efficient with the dollars that we\xe2\x80\x99re recovering through rates. It\xe2\x80\x99s good for our investors in that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to reduce the amount that\xe2\x80\x99s just an O&M pass through and that allows us headroom for investment that we\xe2\x80\x99re making on behalf of our customers and that represents earnings to our shareholders.
That decrease in O&M that we talked about hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened by chance. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a number of different initiatives to go about and get that. When we were looking at 2013 from 2012, we realized that what was happening because of the repositioning of our Ohio business was going to cause us to have to go about and fill in some gaps that the reduced earnings were going to create for us there. We partnered with a consulting firm and launched what Nick called a repositioning study that focused on five areas. Those are finance and accounting, IT, lean generation, supply chain and procurement and organizational effectiveness.
By focusing on those areas and by holding senior executives accountable to getting the dollars from those places that we\xe2\x80\x99re focusing on, we were able to fill in a significant gap of what the earnings gap was going to be 2012 to 2013 and able to continue to grow our earnings per share. We realize as we look forward that whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a capacity auction, whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s a transition from regulated markets to a competitive market in the state of Ohio, that there\xe2\x80\x99s also going to be some earnings gaps that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to fill. 
So instead of talking about a repositioning study that makes it sound like a onetime effort, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be focused for the next several years on initiatives that we call continuous improvement. So each year we\xe2\x80\x99re going to identify four or five initiatives that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on as a company and make sure that we extract the value for the benefit of our customers and shareholders on those initiatives.
For 2014, we\xe2\x80\x99ve identified that continuing the lean generation initiative and rolling that out across multiple plants is the way that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go. The IT is going to continue. We are going to roll out the procurement and supply chain effort across incremental functions from what we focused on in 2013 where it was mostly focused on O&M. we\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on not just O&M efforts, but capital as well and the thought there being, if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to reduce the capital that we need to spend on things that we need to spend it on, the break fix keep the lights on, restore people to service after storms, that type of thing. 
Even if we spend the same amount of capital overall, we can rotate incremental capital into the places where we want to put incremental capital to work, places like the TRANSCOs and Transource. So being smarter, even with our CapEx dollars, being more prudent with the CapEx spend, allows us to capital allocate, capital rotate in the higher growth areas of the business. Much as we rolled lean generation out to the generation side of the business, we\xe2\x80\x99re also going to be focused on lean distribution. In the first year I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the dollars of savings here are going to be that great. 
But the improved efficiencies and the impact on customer service and customer reliability are likely to be significant. So we\xe2\x80\x99re very much focused on that effort. And then there are going to be other efforts that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on and those could include things like inventory opportunities that we have, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s on fuel inventory, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s on inventory on hand in the storerooms across the system, things that may not have immediate O&M or earnings impacts, but thing that on the system or size when you\xe2\x80\x99re spending $3.4 billion a year on O&M, $3.5 billion a year on CapEx, even small numbers can make for some significant cash opportunities for you that you can then plough back into the business. So we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking for those opportunities as well.
A year from now I hope to be here talking to you about what our efforts are for 2015 and then \xe2\x80\x9915 we\xe2\x80\x99ll have initiatives for \xe2\x80\x9916 and this is very much becoming a part of who we are at AEP. Coincident with this, Nick is rolling out and the company is rolling out a cultural initiative that allows us to move from being reliability, traditional regulated utility focus where there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of great things that are going on as a company, a safety focus, a customer focus, a reliability focus and rolling out some initiatives that would allow us to be self-critical of our ourselves against a competitive regime.
So allow us to look at things and say how could we do that more efficiently. How could we save dollars for the benefit of our customers and how could we improve service, allow more headroom for investment on behalf of our customers and obviously that benefits our shareholders as well. So we\xe2\x80\x99re not standing back and being a traditional utility running a traditional business. We\xe2\x80\x99re really trying to transform ourselves and focus on how we spend every dollar. Is it for the benefit of our customers? Is there some opportunity to improve service, improve efficiency and at the same time benefit our shareholders?
So continued successful regulatory proceedings. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about some of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on in regard to corporate separation. We had six filings that we made at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Three of those have been approved; the corporate separation, the plant transfers and the Wheeling APCO merger have all been approved. The three that we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting on are the pool termination, the operating agreements in terms of how we run the plants and then with the new power coordination agreement or some of you might think of it as the new pool arrangement will work. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have what we believe to be significant intervention in those and believe we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to get those three orders out of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by the end of the year.
Kentucky Power, in regard to the asset transfers, we do have a non-unanimous settlement before the commission. We anticipate getting an answer from that within the next month and a half to two months. That would have the effect of we would then withdraw our filed base rate case in Kentucky and not come in again until early 1\xe2\x80\x995 with a base rate and we would have rates frozen until that time. But we would get recovery of some of the issues that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with around future investment in Big Sandy One and retirement of Big Sandy Two as well as the transfer of half of Mitchell into Kentucky Power.
Appalachian Power is a little bit complicated right now in that we did get an order out of Virginia for Appalachian Power that authorized the transfer of Amos, authorized the merger of Wheeling Power into APCO, but denied the transfer of Mitchell into APCO which would leave \xe2\x80\x93 after the merger would leave APCO short. So then we go to West Virginia where there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong interest in having Wheeling Power merge into APCO. There was also a strong interest we believe in having the assets transferred into APCO to effect the merger of the Wheeling to APCO merger. And now with Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s denial of Mitchell, we have some things that we need to work out. 
We want to make sure that we meet West Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s needs which I think are to have the merger happen. But we also want to make sure that we are able to effect as much of the asset transfer as we can. We think there\xe2\x80\x99s very strong support for the transfer of Amos into APCO and we need to find a way to meet West Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s needs on the merger of Wheeling and APCO and our needs on being able to get paid for Mitchell as we go about effecting that merger. So those are the things that are in play. Charles Patton and his team have their sleeves rolled up and are trying their best to meet a settlement that meets the interveners needs down there as well as the company\xe2\x80\x99s needs.
I mentioned earlier the Kentucky Power base case will be pulled if the settlement is filed. We are hopeful and optimistic that that will happen. So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk too much about their base case. Today in Texas we heard more from the commissioners as they consider an open meeting, what their thoughts are in regard to the base rate case that would put Turk install in the base rates there. As best we can tell, it sounds like they\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable with the 9.65% ROE. They\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable with environmental consumables being put through fuel. They\xe2\x80\x99re obviously comfortable with the prudency of Turk.
They\xe2\x80\x99ve split to some degree we understand on some of the settlements that we had to make with some of the environmental and community groups. It seems like they\xe2\x80\x99re okay with the Hunting Club settlement being accepted into recovery. And it seems that they\xe2\x80\x99ve deferred for future consideration this year a club settlement that we entered into to effect. Getting Turk completed and rates and getting some of those court cases settled. So more on this later. It seems like there\xe2\x80\x99s a mid-40s type of rate increase that is anticipated. And I think many of you will remember that the effective rates will be effective after January 29 of this year. So there could be a significant component of that that will still happen in 2013. 
Future rate cases, Appalachian Power, we need to file our biannual case there by March 31 of next year which we will do. Appalachian Power West Virginia, we need to file our case by the middle part of next year. And that was part of the settlement on the ENEC case that we effected earlier this year. And then Public Service of Oklahoma needs to file its rate case by the first of next year with rates to potentially go into effect within six months subject to refund. So very limited regulatory lag.
Those are the cases that we know are up for next year. And then as I mentioned there are some other cases that may be filed depending on how the year plays out and how our individual operating companies and their staffs are able to work with commissioners in their states to effect those changes.
We are reaffirming our earnings growth rate of $5 to 6%. That was something that we laid out in February of this year. It\xe2\x80\x99s as we said earlier predicated on future investment in our regulated properties. We came out in February of last year with guidance of $3.05 and $3.25 for 2013 and $3.15 to $3.45 for 2014. We are reaffirming those guidance ranges, but we\xe2\x80\x99re also reaffirming earnings per share growth rate. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just out there for one year. I regularly get the question, how long is that 4% to 6% earnings per share growth rate out there? And I\xe2\x80\x99m not being cagey with people when I say it\xe2\x80\x99s out there until further notice.
As far as we calculate, as far as we can out the curve, even with some hiccups and some issues that have been raised by the PGM capacity auction, we anticipate being able to fill some of those gaps with some of the cost cutting initiatives that we have, some of the capital rotation initiatives that we have and being able to plough our way through and see our way into that 4% to 6% earnings growth rate. So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just through \xe2\x80\x9914. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just through \xe2\x80\x9916. It\xe2\x80\x99s until further notice and we see our way being clear to being able to get that growth rate over time.
So let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about the dividend for a moment. It\xe2\x80\x99s something obviously that\xe2\x80\x98s been a strong component of what shareholders expect from us. If you look at our compound annual growth rate since 2004 through 2013, estimated 3.69% CAGR on that. $1.94 estimated for this year. Current yield, 4.6%, a healthy yield in today\xe2\x80\x99s environment. Payment $0.49 a share. Payout ratio, 62%. We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk in a moment about dividend policy, and obviously given the fact that we paid a quarterly dividend for 413 consecutive quarters, that\xe2\x80\x99s a large part of who we are. We recognize that our investors require or demand a cash return on their earnings from us and that is something that our board is committed to over time is making sure that our shareholders are rewarded in that way.
In February of last year we indicated that we were going to increase the targeted dividend payout ratio from 50% to 60% to 60% to 70% of consolidated earnings to reflect that we talk like a regulated utility. We act like a regulated utility. We want to pay a dividend like a regulated utility. So as we said from the earlier side, we\xe2\x80\x99re in the low part of that dividend payout ratio and anticipate that the board will avail themselves of the full range of that. Perhaps as we get through some of the issues that we have on transition right now as we are confident of what cash flows look like as we work our way through this and are in a position to be able to avail ourselves to that. That\xe2\x80\x99s something that the board may consider. The dividend is supported by our regulated operations and is expected to grow in conjunction with the growth in our regulated operations over time.
Talking about the financial health of the company. We are in as strong a position as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been, since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with the company. Debt to total cap, 55.2%, down from the low 60s I think in 2008, 57.2% in 2009. It\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very acutely focused on, our credit metrics and the strength of our balance sheet. Our coverage metrics are very solidly within the BBB to Baa2 range. And we anticipate those being in those ranges for some time. It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we work very hard on is shoring up the balance sheet, making sure it\xe2\x80\x99s as strong as possible. Something the board is very committed to and management has been over time as well.
Qualified pension liability funding has been a strong part of that. We put over $1.15 billion into our qualified pension funding over the last four years, bringing it at the end of the second quarter of this year up to 97% funded. Our OPEBs are now fully funded. We made some changes to retiree medical at the end of \xe2\x80\x93 benefits at the end of last year. And at the end of the second quarter our OPEB liabilities were fully funded at 100%.
Liquidity is as strong as it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been. Our two underlying credit facilities in addition to our term loan facility, give us total liquidity of $4.5 billion with uses of that of about $1 billion, bringing us to a net available liquidity at the end of the second quarter at about $3.5 billion.
So what is the AEP investment opportunity? We\xe2\x80\x99re a regulated business model. It\xe2\x80\x99s clear. It\xe2\x80\x99s line of sight. That\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99re putting our dollars to work. Stable income and cash flows as we talked about. We have significant opportunities to both upgrade our infrastructure, add new infrastructure in response to retiring units environmental CapEx and required wires investment that we need to make. We are across 11 jurisdictions. So we have some diversity there. And our transmission system alone provides some significant opportunity for us and we\xe2\x80\x99re out to get our unfair share of the competitive opportunities that exist out there in the market as well.
We are creating a critical path for our competitive business. Chuck Zebula and Mark McCullough are very focused on that. They\xe2\x80\x99re trying to cost like that business like an IPP would be costed and make sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s competitive under any number of \xe2\x80\x93 any one of a number of competitive environmental pricing scenarios. 
We have a stable dividend, attractive yield and it\xe2\x80\x99s supported as I said by our regulated operations. So that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the board is very committed to. We as a management team are in over 100 years of track record in that record is something that none of us on management and board are going to do anything to disrupt.
The balance sheet is as strong as it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been. Plenty of liquidity as we just talked about. And in terms of equity needs that we might have that are met through the DRIP program that we have brings in about $100 million a year. Some of the securitization opportunities that we have, primarily in Ohio and West Virginia, Ohio well on its way, West Virginia underway. We anticipate being able to do late third quarter, early fourth quarter and the bonus deprecation opportunities that we\xe2\x80\x99ve availed ourselves of. So a combination of those things significantly supports the CapEx program that we have and our other cash needs and we don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate any incremental equity as far as we can see at this point. 
Finally we\xe2\x80\x99d like to talk about the fact that we are reiterating our 4% to 6% earnings per share growth rate off of the 2013. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just for this year. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just for next year. That is a growth rate that the management team is committed to and we have significant initiatives underway to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to meet that commitment to our shareholders.
Concludes my prepared remarks and I will turn it over to the floor, Dan, for questions.

Thank you very much. And we do have a microphone coming around. We have a question here in front.
Andrew Levi \xe2\x80\x93 Avon Capital
Hi. It\xe2\x80\x99s Andy Levi from Avon Capital. Can you just talk about as we approach EEI, what type of information we should expect from you as far these initiatives? Will there be numbers behind some of them? Will there be an update on CapEx? Will there be more detail on CapEx? Will there also be more details as far as being able to better analyze the company, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the GENCO, et cetera?
Brian Tierney
Thanks again for the question. So there are a number of things that we plan on providing some more detail on at EEI. One of those is the cost structure associated with our GENCO. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to provide more clarity on that. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to discuss in more detail the additional opportunities that we have at our TRANSCOs and Transource and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to lay out another year. So you have now through 2015. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to lay out through 2016 and also put a range around what a flex opportunity on that might be. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99d call it, either backlog or projects that are still under consideration by RTOs and are awaiting approval. So we\xe2\x80\x99ll show what the flex upside could be around that. 
We\xe2\x80\x99ll also talk as you asked about some specificity around the continuous improvement initiatives and what we think the size of the pie might be there and how we\xe2\x80\x99d anticipate going after that programmatically over time. And then of course we are going to talk about since this is a large part of our growth story, how and where we\xe2\x80\x99re putting the dollars to work in our regulated businesses from a CapEx standpoint, what the plan is for getting those projects and service for the benefit of our customers and then how we would get that reflected in rates for the benefit of our shareholders.

The GENCOS cost structure was the first thing?
Brian Tierney
Yeah. So we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get some sense for how competitive that business is.

And that finishes the time that we have available. There is a breakout session in Liberty Number 5 if you want to follow up with further questions. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to thank Brian very much for his presentation.
