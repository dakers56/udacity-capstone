Q - Matthew Harrison
Good afternoon everybody and thanks for joining us again. So, I\xe2\x80\x99m Matthew Harrison, one of the biotech analysts here at Morgan Stanley. Just quickly before we get started, I need to read the disclosure statement. Please note that all important disclosures including Personal Holdings disclosures and Morgan Stanley disclosures appear on the Morgan Stanley public website at morganstanley.com/research disclosures or you can pick up a copy at the registration desk. So, here we have Alexion. And I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to have with me David Hallal, the CEO of Alexion. David, I thought to start off, can\xe2\x80\x99t remember how long, but you are relatively new in the CEO seat, so I thought maybe you could just talk what surprised you most about stepping into that seat. Obviously you\xe2\x80\x99ve known the company well and you have been involved in the commercial infrastructure of the company for a while, but maybe stepping into seat, what surprised you most?
David Hallal
So as you know Matt, I\xe2\x80\x99m with Alexion for nine plus years at the time of the announcement of Lenny\xe2\x80\x99s retirement and my appointment. And it starts really over that nine-year period of time which was a point in which we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have drug on the market and as Lenny would have said, a lot of failure along the way. And now here we are as a company ready to make that transition from a single product to a multi-product company, multiple therapeutic areas, global launch for both the Strensiq and Kanuma in the fold. So, thinking back at that time and over those nine plus years, we largely built the multiple national company on the fly.
And as it relates to surprises, there really hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been one of note, but I would say that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been exceptionally busy, as you know, announcing the acquisition of Synageva in May, closing that deal in the second quarter, moving through the regulatory processes for both Strensiq and Kanuma where we now have European approval for both drugs as well as Japanese approval for Strensiq for HPP, we are in the home stretch in the U.S. regulatory process for both drugs, and we also now have the most robust pipeline in the company\xe2\x80\x99s history where we have a number of Phase III registration trials that are ongoing. We exceeded target enrollment in the MG trial earlier this year. And of course we\xe2\x80\x99re very excited with the opportunity to advance the lead next generation Soliris molecule ALXN 1210 into a PNH trial by the end of this year.
Matthew Harrison
And then maybe just separately, is your vision for Alexion any different than Lenny\xe2\x80\x99s was? Do you see any differential approach that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to take?
David Hallal
Matt, it\xe2\x80\x99s an often asked question of me. And again, over the 10 years in which Lenny and I worked together in leading the company and even now we have very close partnership with he as Chairman and me as CEO. The transition was really -- and I\xe2\x80\x99d say the vision was really about continuity. Continuity from a successful 23 years under Lenny\xe2\x80\x99s leadership to appoint now where we continue to kind of focus on what we know well and do well, which is we\xe2\x80\x99re a company of high science and high innovation. We focused on those diseases that are devastating and rare. And we continue to focus on therapies that are nothing short of transformative for patients as opposed to those who provide incremental benefits. And Lenny created that vision. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a vision that in the midst of the transition, we are not ever losing side of.
And then, I would just add to that. We really are now a company with revenues that we projected out to be at $2.6 billion in 2015 and yet all of that was built by serving patients one at a time, by focusing on ultra-rare populations of patients. As an organization, we have a patient centric culture that is how our day begins and ends and that\xe2\x80\x99s important for us moving forward into the future.
Matthew Harrison
Great. So, I thought maybe we could talk a little bit about the base business, then move on to some of the new products that you\xe2\x80\x99re starting to launch. So, I think one of the key questions I always get is about currency; what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in the emerging markets and that impact on your business. So, maybe we could just take some of those in turn. So, can we talk about China, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on there in terms of currency and just how big the business is there, surely to extent you can talk about that?
David Hallal
Sure. Across our 50-country operating platform, our Soliris revenues are largely broken up into three components, about a third in the U.S.; a third in Europe; and then, a third rest of world. When we look at Asia Pacific, the majority of our sales in that region is really comprised of a very strong Japanese business as well as Korea. We do have a Shanghai office and yet that office today is largely overseeing our operations in Taiwan and Hong Kong. And at this point, we have not commercialized in Mainland China, we continue to assess it as an organization. So, it really hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had an impact in any meaningful way except for the domino effect as you know, across variety of macroeconomic measures.
Matthew Harrison
So then, I guess in terms of the domino effect into emerging market currency, maybe you can just talk a little about; obviously currencies had an impact this year. We see more pressure on those EM currencies. So how that translates to next year; will we see an impact next year from those currencies?
David Hallal
So, this year is interesting with -- as the company of our size, we tend to have significant exposure outside of the U.S. due to our success in serving patients across the 50-country platform. As you say Matt, this year\xe2\x80\x99s impact, if we did not have a hedging program in place, would have been close to 320 million in revenues but the approach that we have taken with our hedging strategy across selected currencies is to have about 50% of those non-USD sales hedged. And as a result, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to minimize that exposure down to 160 million this year.
As it relates [Audio Gap] and as it relates to 2016 in our end of year call when we provide 2016 guidance, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a better position to reflect what we think the impact will be.
Matthew Harrison
And then maybe just outside of FX, any changes to rest of world volumes -- or volumes continue to look good but it\xe2\x80\x99s just really the impact of FX?
David Hallal
Yes. We often speak about the success that we continue to have in our core markets of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan and we say that because they are the countries in which we\xe2\x80\x99ve been operating the longest whereby we had our first Soliris approval in the U.S. in 2007 and Europe in 2007 and Japan 2010. And we focus on those core markets in terms of our ongoing success because it highlights the durability of our PNH and aHUS franchises that is that in 2015, we continue to add a similar number of new patients on to therapy today as we did back in 2007, 2008, 2009 through the success of our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives. And that says a lot about the durability of the PNH franchise.
As it relates to be the other markets and the emerging markets, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen as we\xe2\x80\x99ve launched the later is a very similar pattern and that is as we enter the countries and our teams extend our disease awareness programs throughout countries like Brazil and Turkey and Russia, we continue to see a steady increase of new patients that are identified and started on treatment. And so when we look at the strength of our global business, it\xe2\x80\x99s very consistent in both our core and emerging countries.
Matthew Harrison
So, maybe we can move on to Kanuma. And I guess sort of the first question is just around you recently had an FDA delay, very novel manufacturing platform there. I think there is some investors concerned around what exactly the delay was related to. So, maybe you could just sort of explain what happened there and what your view is on the potential for volume given three months delay?
David Hallal
So, there was a request from the FDA, as we indicated, for additional information that was CMC related. We provided that information to the FDA. And they wanted time to process that information and work through it with us. And as a result, they really were left with very few options other than to extend the action date by three months, which they have. We are obviously under both break through therapy designation and priority review. As you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned, one thing we were very clear about is that with that unique novel manufacturing platform, the information requested had nothing to do with the unique protein expression platform that has with the transgenic chicken. And so where it is it\xe2\x80\x99s across or within CMC. Given breakthrough therapy designation, we continue to have ongoing dialogue with the agency. There was no request for additional clinical information at all. Obviously we have very robust clinical data, showing a survival benefit of Kanuma in infants and that of course is we just announced last week a publication in New England Journal of Medicine for the pivotal Phase 3 trial in children and adults.
And importantly also in 2015, we expected a small initial contribution to revenues from Kanuma in the U.S. We elevated our revenue guidance back on July 30th on the strength of the current Soliris business. That guidance remains unchanged. And of course in addition to that Kanuma is approved in Europe and we will begin launching in Germany in October. And I would just say, we obviously are still planning for a launch of Kanuma in the U.S. in the second half of this year.
Matthew Harrison
Got you. So, I guess one, with the delay, should we think realistically about seeing any U.S. sales this year? If you were to say it\xe2\x80\x99s a full three months I guess should be the question.
David Hallal
Yes, if you were to take a full three months, then there might be again a small initial contribution. We felt along across both Strensiq and Kanuma that contribution would be small. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a very steady and solid year once again with Soliris in PNH and aHUS which enabled us to raise revenue guidance and hold that. And as we move forward in the U.S., we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to implement our disease awareness and diagnostic preapproval initiatives for both LAL-D and HPP so that we\xe2\x80\x99re in a best position to serve patients at approval.
Matthew Harrison
And then, so you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about Germany and that a lunch in October, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll see the price in Germany in October then if that one because obviously you can set the price Germany as opposed to some other European\xe2\x80\xa6
David Hallal
That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly right. So, the EC approval which we announced on September 1 really starts the process in Europe for the country by country reimbursement processes. But Matt, as you say, we have an opportunity to launch immediately in Germany. And that will happen that will commence in October for both Kanuma and for LAL-D as well as Strensiq in HPP, and at that point there would be a known price.
Matthew Harrison
And just you\xe2\x80\x99ve touched on this a little bit but how should -- what kind of expectations you\xe2\x80\x99re setting around the ramp of this product? I think we all sort of understand the prevalent size of the pool and the incidence relative to present, but maybe just help us think about how expectations should be for the ramp?
David Hallal
Yes, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we have a lot of experience with given the launches of Soliris and PNH and aHUS and that is really due to as Matt is indicating, in many cases unknown incidence of the disease or lack of sufficient data on incidence of disease. In general, the low prevalence of disease which is why these are considered not just orphan but ultra-orphan drugs combined with the fact that many physicians without a highly effective treatment option are not necessarily moved to become educated about the disease and at which patients are at higher likelihood for having the disease that leads to an extremely low diagnostic rate.
And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen with PNH and aHUS, one can have an impact over time. And expertise has enabled us to serve patients around the world. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s our approach. We will run the playbook from Soliris over to our new metabolic franchise in both LAL-D and HPP. But we would expect the launch trajectory to be slow and steady over time as physicians appreciate the devastating nature of each of these diseases that they understand which patients are at higher likelihood for having the diseases which have to order which a lab can produce the test, and then ultimately once the patient is diagnosed, making the best informed treatment decision with what should be to highly effective enzyme replacement therapies that are available for them and their patients.
Matthew Harrison
And just in terms -- you also talked about disease awareness education and ability to get drug on a compassionate new space in the interim as we wait for approval. I mean any of those things informed, how you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about launch trajectory just in terms patients that have been identified, patients that you have on companionate use and your ability to converse them to commercial patient?
David Hallal
So, initially in this ultra-orphan space, the patients that were either involved in the registration program or did gain access to treatment through say an early access program, would be an initial group of patients that would start on treatment at approval, and we can that our clinical transitioning program. Important to note that when one looks at the pivotal trials for both Strensiq and Kanuma, they were approximately 70 to 75 patients involved in the pivotal trial. And then recognizing they are multinational trials, in any one country, there is not such as a substantial number of patients that it recognizes pent up demand. Nevertheless, those patients are important. And they usually are the first ones out that move on to initial commercial therapy.
Matthew Harrison
So, maybe just one or two questions on Strensiq because I think we touched on a lot of this for the topic, which is similar between the two drugs, but maybe specifically just in terms of expectations for that launch. Is this really going to be driven by incidence at launch or is there an ability to penetrate any of the prevalence for Strensiq?
David Hallal
It\xe2\x80\x99s a great question. So, the best published data today that exists on the incidence of hypophosphatasia in the youngest patients is somewhere between 1 in 100,000 and 1 in 300,000 live births. So that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously typically a low number of patients. And yes, we know it carries with it in those patients a mortality rate that exceeds 70% of three years. So, we have a high sense of urgency to be there for those patients.
At launch, we would expect a combination of both incident patients but not just the youngest incident patients but also as you know there is juvenile-onset form of the disease as children start to exhibit whole tooth loss before the age four and start to demonstrate the symptoms associated with hypophosphatasia that impact strength, mobility, agility and growth, those two are diagnostic initiatives and disease awareness programs, will help those children to hopefully be diagnosed sooner and of course -- and out fast test which is readily available for most physicians can kind of help to rule in hypophosphatasia.
So in summary, we would say at approval, we would expect a proportion of patients to be incidents but there is a prevalent pool out there that we could serve as well as the juvenile-onset population doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have its higher mortality rate as say the youngest patients, the infantile onset patients.
Matthew Harrison
Okay. And then any differences in terms of some of the launch concerns, you talked about between Kanuma and Strensiq here in terms of ramp in the EU, ramp in the U.S., any of those that are particularly different between the two of them?
David Hallal
The headline news is slow and steady. However, what would be a likely comparison that one would make is Strensiq to Kanuma within our own metabolic portfolio. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the HPP program now since the first quarter of 2012. So, we\xe2\x80\x99re more familiar with it of course. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had more time to actually apply our playbook and our expertise to the disease awareness objectives that we have. And I would say we are ahead in terms of HPP than where we are with LAL-D but we have extremely strong conviction that both are such significant meaningful opportunities in terms of serving patients and then ultimately revenue. But I would expect that HPP would sort of front run LAL-D just because it\xe2\x80\x99s been in our hands for several years longer.
Matthew Harrison
Okay. So, I want to touch on various sort of pipeline topics but maybe before we get there, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to host an R&D day towards the end of the year, what should we think about being discussed there; what\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of that day for you guys; and as we walk through the pipeline, what you think is going to be most relevant there?
David Hallal
We are confident as a company that we are at the strongest point in our history on every -- really by any measure. From a business perspective we\xe2\x80\x99ve exceeded or will exceed $2.5 billion in revenues, largely with Soliris in PNH aHUS. And yes, we see the majority of growth still in front of us that there is a tremendous opportunity to continue to identify and serve patients. So, I think we\xe2\x80\x99d like to provide a little bit perspective on that as well as the upcoming launches of the metabolic franchise in Strensiq and Kanuma and how we\xe2\x80\x99re applying our expertise to that launch. So, as much as an R&D day, it\xe2\x80\x99s really an investor day or an analyst day to give full color on both our business objectives and our in line products as well as the pipeline. As it relates to the pipeline, we look forward to sharing with the attendees a broad array of programs that we have in our pipeline from the late stage programs, the Phase III programs that we are currently enrolling patients in as well as all the way back up into the earlier stages of our pipeline.
Today we have eight highly innovative products in clinical development for 11 different indications that does include Strensiq and Kanuma and at the same time, we now have 30 preclinical programs, four of which will move into the clinic in 2016. And we look forward to providing more insight on the overall growing pipeline which we consider to be the most robust of rare disease pipeline in biotech.
Matthew Harrison
So maybe before we jump in your pipeline, just a minute or two on Soliris competition like we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen one or two competitors or potential competitors I should say release some very early data sets. Any thoughts you want to just share on those as potential competitors and when you look at the data what you think?
David Hallal
Yes. What I would say as it is early as you indicated. There have been some claims made by some other organizations from either healthy volunteer data or very, very early, very few patients in terms of clinical experience that has come out in a variety of different ways, but not necessarily at medical congresses or through a peer reviewed process. And so, what we would say is first and foremost, the seven complement inhibitors behind Soliris, my objective and our objective for our complement franchise is to outcompete ourselves. That we feel like we have the tremendous opportunity not just to maintain, but extend our leadership position and complement biology. And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got three complement inhibitors in clinical development, we have four other complement inhibitors in a preclinical stage, one of which will move into the clinic in 2016 and of course we have now shared some of the attributes of our lead next generation Soliris program ALXN 1210, which is a longer acting anti-C5 monoclonal antibody that is suitable for monthly dosing.
Soliris today is infused on an every two weeks schedule. We are completing our healthy volunteer studies now. We will be into a proof of concept study in PNH by the end of the year. And we would expect that one of our complement inhibitors would be approved in 2018. And that\xe2\x80\x99s important to us because we\xe2\x80\x99ve been serving patients now since 2007, since our initial approvals, some back to much earlier than that in our initial trials. And as I mentioned earlier, our focus as a culture is patient centricity, we want to provide patients the highest level of innovation, we want to provide them optionality for a highly effective and safe complement inhibitor and I would just say it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note.
Due to all of the clinical trials we have run, Soliris has more than 15,000 patients of experience, 1,000 since that have been treated since our approvals around the world. The PNH program in and of itself had 195 patients included in that clinical program and then lastly even aHUS that at the time of the aHUS approval there was significant long-term safety data on eculizumab in Soliris. And why is that important? That\xe2\x80\x99s important because when one is modifying the complement system, we all know that the complement system plays an important role in host of things across the broad spectrum of pathogens. And Soliris has proven predictable safety to go along with highly innovative transformative clinical benefits. And we will see what the others perhaps may have as they enter the later phases of testing.
Matthew Harrison
And then one of the questions I get a lot is just around potential approval pathway, given the rare nature of the disease and dramatic benefits that Soliris provides. What\xe2\x80\x99s your view on -- because clearly, you are developing next generation products as well, so what\xe2\x80\x99s your view on getting patients to take a different therapy and then the bar for an approval pathway in that setting?
David Hallal
Matt, we see the bar is set exceptionally high. The eculizumab or Soliris, and it says that in the U.S. labels, all study patients had an objective response to treatment as measured by either a reduction in hemolysis in PNH patients or a reduction in complement activity in aHUS patients. And the benefits are, as you mentioned, exceptionally high.
Where there was a 35% death rate for patients with PNH before Soliris, there is now published literature showing that patients who receive Soliris can expect the benefits to even include that of near normal life expectancy and that\xe2\x80\x99s published literature from independent sites. And as it relates to aHUS, you have 80% of patients that were enrolled in the trials and on dialysis were able to eliminate dialysis. So the bar is exceptionally high.
As we think about the regulatory path, we are being very thoughtful about what the best and fastest approach is and yet we are maintaining that close to the best recognizing that others are seeking very much the same information on how to develop a strategy to exceed a bar that is set very, very high.
Matthew Harrison
And so maybe here in the last minute I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you take a pipeline compound to highlight that you think is -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve interestingly obviously talked about next generation Soliris but maybe there something else\xe2\x80\xa6
David Hallal
Well, thank you Matt. I\xe2\x80\x99d turn to myasthenia gravis. This is a devastating disease in which we designed a Phase III program based upon a strong Phase II proof-of-concept study of patients that no matter what therapy they were receiving that is standard of care, immunosuppressive therapy, IVIG or plasma exchange, continue to show significant disability associated with the disease. We have just exceeded our enrollment target and recoupment is now full in that pivotal Phase III trial. And we look forward to a read-out of that data near mid-2016.
Matthew Harrison
Great. David, thank you very much. I appreciate you being here.
David Hallal
Thanks Matt.
