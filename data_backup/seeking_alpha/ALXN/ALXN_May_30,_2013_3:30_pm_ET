Thank you all for joining us and staying this afternoon. So my name is Robyn Karnauskas, I\'m one of the Deutsche Bank Biotechnology analysts. Next, we have Alexion Pharmaceuticals, and we have Vikas, who\'s the Chief Financial Officer and Executive VP of Alexion. Just a couple of points for those of you who want to ask questions, we have 2 ways to do so. You can either e-mail me and I\'ll read your question anonymously or as something that\'s been very popular in the last hour or so is a website called Yorn, so it\'s www.yorn/db. And you actually can just go to that website, go to Alexion, and you can actually ask any questions or make comments, and it\'s completely anonymous. And you can just keep writing them, and I\'ll read them as we go. So with that, I\'ll turn it over to Vikas.
Vikas Sinha
Ready? Good afternoon. Thank you, Robyn, for inviting us and thanks to Deutsche Bank for inviting us to this conference. I\'d like to just quickly talk about the forward-looking statements I might make today. So I request you to read our risk factors that are outlined in our 10-Ks and 10-Q filings.
Quickly, to talk about Alexion, we are focused on innovation and commercialization of life-transforming therapies for patients with severe and life-threatening disorders. Soliris is our first commercial product, and it\'s the first and only approved terminal complement inhibitor in the world. It targets life-threatening ultra-rare disorders of uncontrolled complement activation.
Our first indication, PNH, is now approved in 40 countries. It\'s growing its core operations in U.S., Western Europe and Japan, and expanding into Turkey, Brazil, Russia and more.
Our second indication, aHUS, was approved in U.S. and E.U. late 2011. U.S. launch is undergoing, and launches in E.U. countries are continuing throughout 2013 and will move into \'14.
Growing in severe and ultra-rare disorders beyond PNH and aHUS, we\'re taking 2 tracks: first is to expand the Soliris pipeline beyond PNH and aHUS. We have 5 lead programs, STEC-HUS, NMO, MG kidney transplant rejection and delayed-graft function. And we are also looking at additional expansion opportunities there.
Beyond Soliris, we have 4 additional highly innovative therapeutic candidates: asfotase alfa for hypophosphatasia. We got this from the acquisition of Enobia last year. cPMP replacement therapy for Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency Type A. It\'s in pre-R&D stage. We will be moving into clinical this year, later or early next year. Alexion 1007, it\'s a novel anti-inflammatory antibody. It is in Phase I. We are preparing for multidose study. And Alexion 1102 and 1103 is in Phase I. This came from the Taligen acquisition. We are a profitable company, with increasing operating leverage right now, with 1,500 employees worldwide and sales in 50-plus countries.
In terms of our financials, last quarter was $338.9 million in sales, with $131 million in non-GAAP net income. The sales growth was approximately 38% year-over-year and our non-GAAP net income increased by 49% during the same period.
As we look at the full year guidance, 2013 revenue forecast is now at 24% growth over 2012. And our non-GAAP EPS forecast is expected to grow at 37% over 2012.
Talking about PNH and aHUS, both are severe and life-threatening ultra-rare disorders. PNH is our first indication and it\'s an acquired genetic complement inhibitor deficiency affecting blood cells. It\'s defined by a presence of hemolysis, patients suffer progressive disease burden and/or vital organ damage, and approximately 35% of patients die within 5 years of onset. And on aHUS, which is our second indication, it\'s a genetic complement inhibitor deficiency affecting all cells, significant pediatric population here leads to clotting in the small blood vessels, and it\'s again, a progressive and a sudden damage to vital organs, resulting in stroke, heart attack and renal failure. More than 50% of the patients die, have kidney failure or required dialysis within 1 year of diagnosis.
Soliris is a targeted C5 complement inhibitor addressing both disorders. All patients responded to Soliris in registration studies. Now -- and as we further study the disease, the published -- new publications are showing that it increased longevity of Soliris patients.
We -- in terms of our launches, U.S., we are continuing to find more patients by better diagnostics, and we\'ll continue to deepen our penetration. In E.U., we are again, in the PNH side, we are deepening our penetration there with better diagnostics. Japan launch has been excellent since 2010 and we\'re continuing to grow. In Turkey, Brazil, and Russia, we are now growing our markets and additional country launches are expected as we go farther in Middle East, LatAm and some Asian countries.
Just to give an overall view on PNH, U.S., Western Europe and Japan, we\'re expanding our field teams to support PNH and aHUS. We\'re building our disease awareness and reaching to a larger population. Diagnostics in each area are resulting in consistent identification of new patients with PNH. A continuous, steady addition of new patients treated with Soliris is being seen all over the world. And our clinical value proposition is resulting in rapid treatment initiation.
In terms of -- in emerging markets, Turkey, Brazil and Russia, these are in early stages of disease awareness and diagnostics initiatives, and initial patients are starting treatment. Korea is among one of the next countries that we will see more patients getting added. Latin America, we still have a lot of work to do. We have started with -- Brazil and Colombia, but we still need to work more on Argentina and Mexico.
In terms of aHUS, U.S. has launched, and we are further working on deepening into the hospital and the community settings. In E.U., 5 countries, we\'re continuing to complete our reimbursement discussion and go further. I\'ll talk a little bit more on the reimbursement status. Japan, we expect to get into the market in 2014, later part of 2014. And Turkey, Brazil, we\'re looking at also moving into these areas later in 2014, followed by Russia and other additional countries.
In aHUS, we have created -- we are building upon a strong foundation that was built on PNH and we have a strong support from leading experts with the recent publications supporting Soliris as a first-line treatment. Diagnostics path for aHUS is being introduced with very positive impact. And after 1 year of approval, individual country launches are on track. U.S. launch advances into second year, we have -- we\'re looking at 3 areas where the patients are coming from, hematologists, nephrologists and then a small proportion from other specialties like internists, pediatricians and family practitioners.
In terms of our reimbursement status in Europe, Germany, hospital reimbursement was obtained in Q1 2013. Italy, early access program is underway. We are advancing through reimbursement processes. New learns[ph], add on status was granted, facilitating access to hospital reimbursement for initial patients. U.K., positive AGNSS recommendation. We are moving forward with the IFR program. And in turn, clinical policy is expected in the second half. Spain, local reimbursement with national process is underway. France, we have received the ASMR II rating, reimbursement discussions are ongoing right now. We expect to see some conclusions towards the middle of the year. Belgium, reimbursement expected Q3 based on recent government announcements. And Japan, registration filing has been submitted. We expect the launch in 2014.
Expanding Soliris into new severe and ultra-rare disorders beyond PNH and aHUS. We are focusing in rare diseases indications for Soliris beyond PNH and aHUS. We\'re expanding the global Soliris franchise and focusing on severe and ultra-rare disorders. Our diseases -- we\'re looking for are areas which are devastating and life-threatening medical consequences, where there are either no treatment available or those that are available are ineffective. We are also making sure that we look at areas where business mechanism is well understood as target for complement block. And we can do a potential transformative impact on patient lives.
So 5 areas that we\'re looking at is: first, in STEC-HUS; second in neuromyelitis optica; and two areas on kidney transplant, acute humoral rejection and deceased-donor area for kidney transplant; and acute humoral rejection in living-donor, both trials ongoing. We\'re also initiating -- investigated and initiated a trial on delayed transplant graft function; and also, myasthenia gravis. I\'ll speak a little bit more about this as we go forward.
In terms of our 2013 objectives for the development team, kidney transplant -- the enrollment in Phase II deceased-donor kidney transplant trial is completed. We are continuing with our living-donor kidney transplant trial enrollment. We also are looking at accelerating DGF program with additional delayed-graft data from deceased-donor study.
In terms of neuromyelitis optica, data from prior investigative study is expected later in 2013, and we will commence single registration trial in the second half of 2013. Myasthenia gravis, targeting second half 2013 for pivotal registration trial initiation following recent positive discussions with the regulators. STEC-HUS optimal analyzed longer-term additional control data and target for regulatory submission near year end.
Now growing in additional severe and ultra-rare disease -- disorders beyond Soliris, we are looking at focusing on what we know well and do well. We want to apply our bench-to-bedside skills developed in PNH and aHUS to additional severe ultra-rare settings. We seek to only develop therapies with transformative impact on patients lives and to leverage development and commercial skills with both internal and external opportunities. Four such opportunities that we have in hand right now, asfotase alfa, I\'ll talk a little bit more here; cPMP; Alexion 1102 and 1103; and Alexion 1007, which is our anti-inflammatory antibody.
Hypophosphatasia, if you can see the pictures there on the far end, there\'s an HPP patients which is 8 months old and where it\'s close to that of a bone structure of a 9-month normal child, you can see how the bones are not developed here. HPP is a severe, ultra-rare life-threatening genetic metabolic disorder. It manifests with deficient tissue, nonspecific form of alkaline phosphatase, progressive vital organ damage, including destruction and deformity of bones, profound muscle weakness, seizures, impaired renal function and respiratory failure. 50% of the newborn patients die within 1 year.
Asfotase alfa is a highly innovative approach directly addressing the cause of the disease. It targets alkaline phosphatase to replace the missing tissue nonspecific form in deficient tissue, reverses metabolic consequences of HPP. It\'s potential life-threatening therapy and we recently received a Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA.
Our objectives around -- and next steps: to optimize our first-generation manufacturing process which is now completed; enrollment in infant natural history study, which is also now completed; advancing towards the anticipated 2014 filing; to hold interactive discussions with FDA under Breakthrough Therapy designations for patients with prenatal, infantile and juvenile onset HPP, just to remind, if additional juvenile study is needed. We also need to clarify further development program for patients with adult onset HPP; and accelerate asfotase alfa registration program in Japan by continuing enrollment in ongoing registration study in Japan towards 2014 trial completion.
cPMP, to initiate retrospective clinical data collection of cPMP in MoCD Type A commence clinical studies with synthetic cPMP in healthy subjects near mid-year following positive regulatory discussions, commence MoCD natural history study by near midyear.
On 1007, complete single-dose Phase I clinical study and then, initiate a multidose Phase I clinical study towards the second half; and explore development across multiple and severe rare conditions, which we will talk more as we enter into next year.
Regarding 1102 and 1103, completing Phase I studies will be done in second half; and meet with regulators to discuss trial data and development programs in the second half.
In terms of our top line 2013 objectives. Robyn, this is my last slide. Enrollment and data in deceased-donor AMR trial, enrollment in living-donor AMR trial and DGF registration plans; registration trials initiation in both NMO and MG; Japanese clinical development completion in aHUS and enrollment in HPP, registration submissions for STEC-HUS in the U.S. and E.U.; key data publications, presentations and NMO, MG, STEC-HUS, kidney transplant, HPP and aHUS; trial enrollment completion across several lead programs.
Our commercial and financial objectives for 2013: continue to aggressively grow global Soliris revenue for PNH into seventh year; continue to expand into additional larger countries for PNH; aggressively broaden Soliris\' launch for aHUS in the U.S., initiate country base launches in Western Europe, and maintain strong financial discipline as we expand R&D and commercial operations.
To reiterate our guidance, we have revised it during our Q1 call to $1.505 billion to $1.520 billion. This is a 34% growth over 2012. Non-GAAP EPS revised upward in the Q1 call to $2.87 to $2.97, this is a 37% growth over 2012. R&D, $285 million to $295 million in expenses, more towards 19% of sales. And SG&A, $425 million to $435 million, which is 29% of sales, reduced from 31% in 2012. GAAP tax rate will be around 29% to 31%. The non-GAAP tax rate will be 7% to 9%, because we continued to enjoy the benefits of net operating losses in the United States. I\'ll stop my presentation here and would you like me to stand here, sit down?
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Any questions from the audience? The only thing I have on Yorn is a test. Someone wrote test. So I guess, I passed your test. So now, submit a question. All right, so I guess, I\'ll start off. Vikas, so you have the reputation, you\'ve defined reputation and I think, of how a -- orphan drug company or how a company should guide and manage the Street. You\'ve had, over the last few years, and you\'ve always -- the Street\'s always being surprised of the upside, and people look at you -- like almost every company I cover, I always say, I want to be like Alexion, I want to be like Alexion. And over the last few quarters, it seems that the Street -- the beats are not big enough for the street, but at the same time, you\'ve also communicated consistent growth. Is this a new day and age for Alexion? That you\'re not going to see the big beats that we used to see. And do you still just think the people should remember there should be consistent growth over the next -- going forward?
Vikas Sinha
I think the way, once you look at the guidance, as we normally look at all the risk and opportunities, weigh that into when we give our guidance, right? And it becomes our role as leaders of the company to manage those risks and go out and try and achieve those opportunities. And that\'s why when a guidance -- we try to give a guidance, we try to give a very balanced guidance from that perspective. It\'s better to be -- make an error on the beat side than make an error on the other side.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
What do you -- just think -- do you think, though, that the Street that -- is the company different than it was maybe a few years ago, or even a year ago, and is it just going to be more consistent, a more mature company, the only difference is in how you are handling your guidance versus what you\'ve handled in the past? Or how new patient adds are coming on versus how they came on in the past?
Vikas Sinha
I think, to give compliment to our analysts, they\'re getting smarter, too. And -- but the fact is, in a chronic disease, it\'s much easier to forecast as you go forward, and when you are trying to grow from a base, which is very high, the growth percentages and the numbers are not that large, right? There are times when quarterly growth used to be $3 million or $4 million, and that used to be a big number. Now $3 million, $4 million doesn\'t matter anymore, we\'re talking about $20 million, $25 million growth. So the dynamics are very different.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. And then, regarding European expansion, the Street\'s very focused on making sure that you gain reimbursement and it\'s just taking longer for many companies to gain reimbursement in Europe right now. Can you give us any other color regarding U.K. and individual regions in the U.K. and reimbursement?
Vikas Sinha
Yes, it\'s a very good question, because I do hear that quite a lot. But if you reflect back into our ultra-orphan experience, we want to have that -- you have to struggle hard in getting reimbursement in ultra-orphans. But for us, the environment hasn\'t been too different. You just have to convince the people by doing a better -- convincing them that the therapy is focusing towards the life-threatening or life-saving situation. You need to have a very good data to prove that. And then, it just takes time to convince people that the value proposition is the right one, right? So if I look back and compare PNH timeframe with aHUS and then, mainly in Europe, that\'s what you\'re asking, it hasn\'t been dramatically different. Germany is more or less, we\'re there -- not more -- we are there since January, right? The hospital reimbursement wasn\'t an issue in PNH, which was an issue in aHUS, which got resolved. Italy, in in-patient, we were more or less at the same stage at that time, but it\'s nice that we have an infrastructure there that we can sell quicker. U.K., the IFR process, if it goes through, then, we should be there in the second half selling Soliris in the U.K., which I actually compared to the last time, which it took 22 months with more or less the same time frame. Spain, I think, by second half, we will most likely resolve the issues there and France, right? So the time gap wasn\'t as different than as we saw last time. But the thing is, due to the recession in Europe, it sounds like everything is in the newspaper these days, right? And then, Belgium, we recently got a very favorable outcome.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay, that\'s helpful, and I mean, you\'re going to maintain your price, right? So you\'re not going to negotiate price or how willing are you to come down a little bit to get those reimbursements?
Vikas Sinha
There\'s individual discussions with the countries, and also in U.S., right? So when you talk about price, there has been an impact on the price. It\'s not that it hasn\'t been. If you look at, from the U.S. perspective, one of the significant drop in the prices has been in the U.S., especially with the 340B introduction. We have had Medicaid and DoD price cuts going up over this time frame. We have also seen Germany move from 6% discount to 16% discount. There\'s been mechanisms where, in Spain, there was a 4% cut. So there are different ways it gets there, but you get there somehow as you manage the recession over the period. But we try to stay really cognizant of this fact, and try and weigh that into our risks and opportunities.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Do you think the orphan drug model is going to hold long-term, because there was a report that came out saying the orphan drugs are becoming a growing number of health care cost? And how do you manage the company and make decisions on developing drugs going forward, based on your belief on whether or not that model holds?
Vikas Sinha
I wouldn\'t like to comment on the overall market because I don\'t have that good of a view on that. But what I would like to look at it is from the strategy perspective, which we talked about, the value proposition that you need to bring in front of the reimbursement agencies is that the disease have to be really bad. It has to be life-threatening, right? And you can bring a life-transforming therapy in front of them, right? Now think about something like cPMP, for example, it\'s a disease where you\'re missing Molybdenum Cofactor, right? And the child is born, and within 2 days of the birth to 30th day of the birth, the child starts losing the brain and is brain-dead at the end of the 30th day, right? And you can bring a therapy in that market without worrying about the market size, and try and save the child\'s brain, right? I think if you can do something like that, a life-transforming, a life-saving therapy, I think we will always have a spot.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
And for asfotase alfa, what -- that you recently got Breakthrough status for that program, what does that mean as far as clinical development and/or regulatory hurdles for approval?
Vikas Sinha
Yes, and I\'ll also ask Irving to comment on that because he was closely involved in this process. But what I see here with the Breakthrough Therapy designation is that we are able to talk to FDA in a much frequent manner. And as we progress with our -- in building our dose here, we would be able to communicate them at a much -- much regular intervals. I personally do not see any approval time being earlier or anything like that, but I do see the interaction and the guidance you see from the agencies would be higher.
Irving Adler
Yes, actually, thanks, Vikas. So in the -- the designation itself, which people have asked about exactly what does this mean. It is designed to expedite the development of a drug in a setting such as this one. And importantly, it\'s based on preliminary clinical evidence that this candidate therapy would be a substantial improvement over any existing. In the case of HPP, you\'re dealing with only palliative care for what\'s a life-threatening or a deforming disorder. It does provide the benefits Vikas is saying, all the benefits of fast-track, plus the additional discussion. And importantly, it includes advice that might spare patients from being subjected to non-efficacious treatment. With that in mind, one of the things we\'ll be clarifying is whether we need the placebo-controlled study in juveniles.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay, that\'s helpful. And I have a question through Yorn. Thank you. Can you give an estimate of the market opportunity in kidney transplant?
Vikas Sinha
For kidney transplant, as I understand that market, it\'s approximately, just from a U.S. perspective, 16,000 kidneys are transplanted per annum. And as we look at high-risk patients that we are talking about, 10% to 15% of this population would be eligible for Soliris, right? So -- but as we grow, we ought to see a lot of patients in the waiting list right now. And what we don\'t have a good handle on is what proportion of that patient population would be high-risk kidney transplant patients and would be eligible for the drug?
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. And then, as far as STEC-HUS, people are -- a lot of times asking you what -- how often are those patients getting treated right now? Do you have a good sense of what percentage of patients in the United States are getting treated for STEC-HUS?
Vikas Sinha
No, I don\'t think that they are being treated with Soliris. You mean to say, Soliris, right?
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Yes, Soliris.
Vikas Sinha
No. They\'re not -- it\'s not being used.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. And then, next question regarding the next generation Soliris, 1102, 1103 and some undisclosed -- you have several undisclosed products in development, I guess, when does Wall Street -- when does the Street get a sense of what your longer-term strategy is for a company as far as protecting the Soliris revenue stream or that revenue stream?
Vikas Sinha
The next generation Soliris, we have several compounds right now in preclinical and then, some which is, say, 1102, 1103. But I would have more focus on that is -- in the preclinical trial, yes. And several of them -- we are right now, I think, in the process of prioritizing it during this year, which ones we want to take forward, maybe 1, maybe 2 or maybe 3 of them, and then, bring it to clinic next year. That\'s the plan.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Is there other competitors that are developing C3 targeted therapies? And do you see those as a threat? Or is it -- will everything become clear once we see what your preclinical program is?
Vikas Sinha
I really don\'t want to comment on others who are building the drug. The thing is, most of them are not in humans, right? They\'re still in preclinical stage, and it\'s a very different situation, preclinical versus only on humans. And so let\'s wait and see what they\'ll bring. But from our own perspective, we would like to do better for the PNH patients and aHUS patients.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Do you think you will release the data on 1102 and 1103, or just keep it in-house? Is that something that could be presented this year or is it something you would maybe not present?
Vikas Sinha
I don\'t think there is a plan to present this year, right? I don\'t think so. But we will prioritize things internally and bring the right candidates forward next year.
Salveen J. Richter - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
Okay. And then, I have to ask this question, too, Vikas. I got it over email, regarding the 483. So on your last quarter call, you did outline some steps that you\'re taking to resolve the 483, and there are consultants that we spoke to -- said those are the right things, those are the things that you need to be doing. Have you met with the FDA since the quarter call? And what are the next steps? What\'s been going on since that?
Vikas Sinha
The process that we need to follow now is to look at -- we have provided our response to FDA. And now we have to wait and schedule a visit from the FDA into our plant, and we don\'t exactly know when that\'s going to happen. Normally, it\'s done within the 12-month window, and we don\'t know when that\'s going to happen, but we do think, over the next 12 months, we will continue to look forward to that and resolve the issues.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Have you had a sit-down meeting with the FDA?
Vikas Sinha
Since the warning letter? No, no, no.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. And is there any plan to have one?
Vikas Sinha
No, I don\'t think there is. We need to provide a response and they need to come and review it.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Got it. Okay.
Irving Adler
I think that will be the normal process.
Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. Any questions from the audience? All right. Thank you very much.
Vikas Sinha
Thank you, Robyn, for giving us the opportunity.
