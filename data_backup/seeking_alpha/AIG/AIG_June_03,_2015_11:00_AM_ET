Peter Hancock - President and CEO 
Josh Shanker
Hello thank you all for coming and we\'ll get started here. I\'m Josh Shanker, I cover Property and Casualty Insurance Group United States for Deutsche Bank and we are really pleased to have Peter Hancock, CEO of AIG presenting at this time. Peter has come from the banking world to the insurance world over very interesting past. He started at JPMorgan where he was Head of Derivatives Head of Credit and Fixed Income and migrated to be the Vice Chairman of KeyBank but of course his services are really needed by AIG post financial crisis when the financial products booked in the derivatives book need to be unwind to take the risk out of this company and Peter joined the team at that point in time. As that moderated and his skills were obvious he was led to run the P&C business at AIG for a number of years and assent to the role of CEO where he is today. It was a different company than it was five years ago when he joined and clearly he\'s put his imprint upon it and Peter is going to going to give some prepared remarks and then I\'ll ask a few questions and then I\'ll turn to the fireside chat setting, but I hope that you the audience have some questions for Peter and he\'ll be very happy to answer them. 
So please welcome Peter Hancock to the stage and thank you very much.
Peter Hancock 
Josh, thank you very much and it\'s a pleasure to have a chance to speak to you about AIG and also hear from you any questions that I can answer. It\'s been an extraordinary experience to be a part of the team that has led to the reshaping of this company. It\'s been through a period of transition like no large company that I am aware of in terms of the degree to which we have focused it on its core competence and exited distractions, non-core activities that either distracted management\'s attention or more importantly diverted capital away from what we do most productively. 
So if you look at the scale of that it was taking our balance sheet from a highly levered balance sheet pre-crisis to one of the most conservative balance sheets in large cap financial services today. Derivative notionals of over 2.5 trillion pre-crisis to about 130 billion today compare that to the bank SIFIs that are between 20 trillion and 60 trillion with a T. And so we\'ve effectively done by the end of 2012 what GE announced they will do some time in the future. So give you a sense of the delevering of the company and the refocusing of the company during this transition period. 
So we\'re now shifting to a focus on sustainable growth and making sure that each of the components of AIG which today is still by many measures the world\'s largest insurer operating in over 100 countries in jurisdictions with about 90 million customers. To make sure that all of those pieces fit together in a way that best serves our clients. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have organized our company in a way that very much focuses around client needs. So we have a commercial division and a consumer division with three regions. And that matrix effectively ensures that we take and outside in view for our clients as to what is like to do business with us. 
Now to do that we have to make sure that all of the pieces fit together so we look skeptically at whether each of the activities we\'re in are reinforcing each other whether they provide diversification of capabilities and diversification of capital utilization, whether there is shared technology that makes us stronger together. And we are agnostic as to what pieces belong and which pieces do not and on my shareholder letter I made it very clear that we look at that. 
So we start from the perspective how can we most effectively be our clients\' most valued insurer and to do that we need to continually invest in innovations so that we capture the benefits the data can give us to better underwrite risk, better manage claims and better service our clients and do that cost effectively and there has been tremendous amount of innovation going on in financial services in general, but this company and the insurance industry in general is a very data rich environment. 
To give you a sense of the scale of that we pay roughly 1 million claims per month. We pay roughly a 134 million claims per day, whether it\'s a $50 claim for a loss suitcase or a $1 billion for a microchip plant that explodes. So between those bookends there\'s a huge amount of continuous learning which makes us smarter underwriters and the way we synthesize that information and get better at what we do and share those insights with our clients is our value added, it\'s not simply about risk transfer, it\'s about helping our clients manage their risk, manage their uncertainty and empower them to grow their businesses or as individuals to plan their retirements in a way that uses our insights about what they should fear, what they should not fear, what should insure, what they should not insure and what is the most cost effective products that can help them do that.
And when you deliver that through channels that are most convenient for them and the good news is that we have a very broad range of distribution channels that we interact with our clients with. So we\xe2\x80\x99re not beholding into any one distribution channel, they differ obviously by client segment, by geography and here again there is a tremendous amount of change going on as all of you as consumers know we expect a level of digital experience that was unheard of even five years ago. 
So we need to invest to give our clients and our employees the digital tools to really improve the client experience in doing business with us and understanding the risk that they have. So, we\xe2\x80\x99re investing in data, we\xe2\x80\x99re investing in science, we\xe2\x80\x99re investing in digital for our clients and our employees, while at the same time acknowledging that our financial performance needs to improve and we made very clear when we talked about our financial goals that while we think we made tremendous progress, we can do better. So I want to acknowledge that.
So we set three important financial goals. The first was to grow book value per share in each of the next three years, this year, the year after and year after that by more than 10% and that\xe2\x80\x99s inclusive of dividends. Now we have a very, very small dividend today, our dividend yield is less than 1%, but should we increase our dividend, we would adjust that book value per share growth rate to accommodate the cumulative return combining book value growth and dividend, just to give you a sense of how we think about that target. We want to do the right thing in terms of dividend policy. 
The second goal we\xe2\x80\x99ve set is that we intend to reduce net general operating expenses by 3% to 5% per annum. So that\'s net of investments and as I mentioned, we got some very exciting investments in our organic growth opportunities, but we also have a number of savings opportunities that have been in flight for some time and new savings opportunities as we think about how we can better run the company today going forward.
So 3% to 5% net expenses which includes accommodation of our investment plans to continue to grow our business and modernize our business where it needs to be modernized and the good news is last year we made a good head start on that with a GOE down 3.5% on the year before. So it\'s not a standing start, we\xe2\x80\x99ve already got that GOE improvement baked in. And the third goal is that return on equity improvement that we\xe2\x80\x99ve set out as a goal which is 50 basis points annual improvement in our ROE. Now we announced in prior disclosures that we normalized last year\xe2\x80\x99s return on equity at about 7.4%. There are couple of headwinds and a couple of tailwinds that\'s together, netted out to about 100 basis points over statement of these normalized rate. 
Now you may say well that\'s a pretty miserable ROE compared to peers, but peer comparisons are somewhat tricky with our numbers. We have a few idiosyncratic aspects in the calculation of ROEs that you should all be aware of and if you\'re not I am sure Josh can lead you through the math. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a very large DTA, Deferred Tax Asset, which you need to think about. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got AOCI on our unrealized gains and our bonds which has changed dramatically over the last five years as a result of capital gains harvested. We have sold a lot of high coupon bonds both in the life and the property casualty business for all sorts of good reasons and replaced them with lower coupon bonds which have the effect of increasing book equity and reducing net investment income. So as you compare us to peers for instance which I am sure many of you do when you think about our ROE and price-to-book multiple, it\'s worth just taking a look at those cumulative capital gains and what effect it\'s had on the portfolio yield because we have a longer duration liability stream in our P&C business than many of our peers that you may be thinking of that have short tail business.
So just wanted to caution you about that as you look at peer benchmarking as opposed to peer-to-peer benchmarking and our 7.4 number is to help you do peer-to-peer benchmarking for AIG as opposed to peer-to-peer benchmarking against other companies just want to clarify that. So we think a 50 basis point annual improvement on a capital base of over $100 billion is what we think is a prudent, sensible pace at which we can deliver results that get the correct balance between current profitability and a sense of urgency and investing for the future recognizing this is a company founded 95 years ago with a long proud history of client relationships all over the world the go back many decades and that we\'re investing to be around for at least another 95 years.
So balancing short-term priorities and long-term priorities is baked into those goals and we think we get in this balance between profitability today, long-term growth and the other third dimension of our framework we\'re thinking about intrinsic value, which is risk; and if 2008 taught us anything is the financial institution\'s need to have all three drivers of value in mind in good times and bad and we think about that all the time at the macro-level for enterprise risk, but at the micro-level when we decide whether this product or that product, this region or this customer segment offer an appropriate balance between these three. Have we saturated the growth opportunity here and should we optimizing for profitability? Or is this a sector which has got tremendous growth size and we should be less worried about the current profitability and more worried about whether we can build a technology platform that can scale for the growth opportunity.
This sort of strategic thinking is what we are trying to embed at all levels of the organization with a governance structure that gives leaders at the appropriate level in the Company the autonomy to make the trade-offs between profitability growth and risk that adds up to these aggregate financial outcomes that we are promising to you as our shareholders, so that we can deliver sustainable growth in value of the Company. 
So we think about intrinsic value as our goal, it\'s informed by market value but obviously market value can over or under shoot based on perceptions and technical factors, but for us the intrinsic value provides a [true note] that ensures the management is keeping their eye on the proper balance of these short, medium and long-term performance goals and how do we then deliver the sustainable returns that I hope you want to have as holders of our shares.
So in terms of short-term priorities that we have right now with currently very focused on simplifying decision making in the Company and that\xe2\x80\x99s a big driver of the expense initiative, we\'re very focused on improving the technology experience the end-user experience for those employees and clients of the Company. We are very focused on improving the metrics that we have for value based management and here I would say that we\'ve made a lot of progress but we still have a ways to go.
I am a big believer in really looking at the Company through an economic lens so discounting was assets and liabilities at current market. Discount rates really understanding embedded optionality in policies that have been solved and to do so in an industrial strength way where we get a feed loop to managers that they know that regardless of what the GAAP results show positive or negative that we\'re truly adding economic value in what we\'re doing both of the tactical and at the strategic level. And so building the infrastructure to do that efficiency and inform people in the MIS perspective what\'s good business and what\'s not so good business is a really important priority of this year so that we all working from the same information set.
And the final priority this year is to really embed this concept of being customer centric and that really gets to the recognition that for many-many years AIG was a lot of profit centers focused on their own product specialization often with competing brands and competing client strategies. And many of our clients deal with this in many products in many geographies and been able to integrate that and give them a customer experience where they\'re dealing with one AIG is something that they have indicated will really differentiate us from our competitors.
I had one risk officer of one of the top 10 banks who renewed their global property program with us in 110 countries. And this risk manager had been doing business with AIG for over 20 years and he said this renewal was the first time in 20 years that he caught me dealing with one company and that was a very gratifying feedback that we\'re making some impact here. I wish all the risk managers of our clients would say that so we have work to do to get there. 
I would say this idea of becoming our client\'s most valued insurer is something that we can show at different customer segments but let\'s just pick home base since we\'re here in the U.S the Fortune 500. We do business with more than 99% of the Fortune 500 so capturing more clients is not the root to growth. The proportion of those Fortune 500 clients that would designate us their most valued insurer while material and probably higher than any other insurer has plenty of room for improvement. 
So I see tremendous growth in more deeply penetrating the existing client base with more value added products but importantly services, and that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the areas we\'re investing services that make us as valuable to our clients for our risk expertise as our financial capacity. So what we\'re delivering is not just simply our balance sheet but our risk equities. 
So with that I\'d like to turn over to Q&A. 
Q - Josh Shanker
Thanks Peter. You must be wondering who the one to four companies in the Fortune 500 are, but I\'ll work on that. So in your letter to shareholders this is your first letter to shareholders you\xe2\x80\x99ve written and so you lay out I think your vision for the company for the first time I think. I will encourage anyone to read it, of course for me one of the key tenants is the 3% to 5% of expense reduction. Back in 2011 the company said reducing expenses was a very important part of a long term strategy. We spent about three or four years increasing expenses to bring the company to a position where I think it\'s clear now we are over that hump. But to what extent is the 3% to 5% number an inspirational number, to what extent you have confidence around given what you know, I\'ve made the joke that many of the people I know at AIG feel the belt\'s quite tight. How much tightening is there to come or how much of this is certain opportunities like the cessation of the integration in Japan, the global expansion of fraud detection, new technologies for capital analysis and what not. How much can we expect that the 3% to 5% is easy versus 3% to 5% is hard to do.
Peter Hancock 
Well the news on this is it\'s never easy. I think that cost cutting is intellectually easy but emotionally hard, growth is emotionally easy but intellectually very hard if you want to find profitable growth. So just owning that issue is important to get people to the table and I can say that the budgeting process in November and December of last year in the five budgeting cycles I have been in the AIG was the first time where the predominant topic of conversation was how we allocate our expense budget which is the element of what we control most as opposed to top line and other factors that are obviously subject to market forces. 
So getting the focus of the budget process on the things we control most with the first shift in mind set making sure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t make it across the board. I like to tell management that we are paid to make to deliver mixed messages, which means that we have to grow in some places and shrink in others and as you go down the cascading levels of management you\'ll see that we\'re growing in some places and cutting a whole lot more than 3% to 5% in others, so that we reshape we stop the company around activities where we add most value. So it\'s not going to be easy but we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone out with a public target like that if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t think we could do it. 
Josh Shanker
And to what extent do you feel that you have some tailwind on it from the expiration of certain large investments that will seize to be part of the scale -- I obviously don\'t want you to give out numbers, but do we expect they are in that next three years there are some step functions down in terms of expenses that long term budgeting makes it easier to get to those numbers. 
Peter Hancock 
We\'ve had one very big project that\xe2\x80\x99s been going on for a long time really since the \'05 restatement which is modernization of the basic pluming of the finance area the general ledges around the world and that\xe2\x80\x99s tailing off already and has been tailing off. What\'s still underway but will tail off in the latter part of next year is the integration of two very large companies in Japan AIU and Fuji Fire Marine. So these two companies are each over 4000 people quite obsolete systems that converging on a common platform rationalizing a branch networks that goes up and down Japan with hundreds of branches into one that\xe2\x80\x99s one effective. On the Japanese regulatory constraints you can\xe2\x80\x99t jump the gun; you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to wait till they emerge before you eliminate enough number of the overlapping functions. So that will be a bit of a tailwind. 
In addition to that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been migrating a sizeable number of jobs from diffused locations into shared service centers both in the United States and overseas and the pace of that migration is I think peaking this year and will continue, but it\'s about 2,000 jobs per year, it\'s about 1,600 the year before and about 1,000 the year before that. 
So what happens when you got this major migration is you have a mirroring of job functions and that\'s at least elevated expenses and as you start to get over the hump that changes. So the first thing is pooling in the shared service centers, you get labor arbitrage to some extent, but more importantly you start to get critical mass and you start to get more specialized management of work flow so you get work flow optimization and then final step, you get automation. And that\xe2\x80\x99s where the long-term sustainable cost savings come from.
So it\'s a multi-step process, it takes several years, many of these initiatives were started four years ago and so they are coming to fruition, others have been initiated more recently and are still in train.
Josh Shanker
Some more about capital generation and capital return, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been almost a year that first time I heard talk about the subsidiaries generating about $4 billion to $5 billion in dividends to shareholders and the intention that you\xe2\x80\x99ll get $1.5 billion and $2 billion of tax sharing savings as well which in easy math that comes to $5.5 billion to $7 billion available from standard operations. And this year you announced that you intended to return $6 to 7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Now if you read my work, I think the numbers are higher than 5.5 billion to 7 billion, but notwithstanding that you sold about 1.5 billion of non-core assets in the first quarter of the year, it was announced two days ago that you\'re going to reduce [AIG\'s] stake in AerCap of another $2.5 billion. There will be $2 billion one-time capital release out of the direct investment book in this quarter, may have already occurred at this point, I mean that adds to my reckoning another $6 billion that may not have been the accounting when you thought about $6 billion to $7 billion. How often does the Board you revisit the capital plan, how should we think about that incremental $6 billion related to the capital generation elsewhere and -- that\xe2\x80\x99s basically it?
Peter Hancock
So we have initiated a much more dynamic capital planning program, it happens about once a quarter and if necessary on an interim basis between that. So it\'s really a continual process as events change as assets are sold, as opportunities to grow and deploy that capital for organic growth arise, as acquisitions are evaluated. But also as organic growth changes, there is significant cyclicality and there is some pretty capital intensive businesses which have become less attractive and we will pull capital out of them and redeploy those capital elsewhere where it gets a better return. So all of that lends itself to a more dynamic capital planning process than perhaps people had expected. And so when we look at the hierarchy of how we deploy that capital, we believe that when our shares are trading below our estimate of intrinsic value that\xe2\x80\x99s a very, very high priority for where we should spend it.
We have also note at debt reduction last year as an important priority in particular the high conform illiquid debt. So we reduced debt by over $10 billion last year, that debt reduction and debt rationalization is for the most part over. So it\'s really about the equity and we\xe2\x80\x99re watching how it performs relative to intrinsic and I think that we will be dynamically adjusting that as markets change. 
But we recognize the importance of husbanding capital, your capital our shareholders in the room very much with a view to making sure that we return it to you if it does not get an attractive return on risk. So we don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to be idle capital, we want to return it to you, you pump in. 
And linked to that, we are judging at which point we should return to a more normal dividend because we have a nominal dividend today and we see no reason why at some point we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in the pack in terms of dividend yield, dividend payout ratio. So I think, we have to make that trade off based on the economics, but also the signaling that it suggests in terms of our confidence of our sustainable earnings.
Josh Shanker
And you\xe2\x80\x99ve said explicitly that the $6 to $7 billion dollar capital return plan had no bearing on your decisions on what to do with AerCap for the remainder of the year.
Peter Hancock
Alright that excludes the non-core asset we spoke\xe2\x80\xa6
Josh Shanker
Will that call for the other non-core asset sales and we did capital release as well they we\xe2\x80\x99re not contemplated when the $6 to $7 billion was --
Peter Hancock 
I think that while the sum of the DIB and the PICC sale and the spring lease sales come to about a $1 billion. I have to say that the precision with which we do that is not that precise. So I think that we\'d like to think that we run a pretty tight shift here, but that\'s a sort of swing number that I wouldn\'t sort of say was in or out. It\'s in the back of people\'s minds before we set the plan. It got executed while the plan is being approved. I think it\'s very hard to...

These Excel spreadsheets are complicated things. And I\'ll ask one more question and then I\'ll open it up to the floor. Right now, you and a couple other companies are non-bank SIFIs here in the United States. There are some people who believe that they are handicapped. There is -- if you ever thought that\'s the best situation for AIG right now. There even beyond that there\'s G-SII, which I mean I am far beyond my understanding what\'s that going to entail at this point in time. What are the costs for AIG to get out from under the regulation of these things? What are the benefits AIG is currently enjoying because it\'s in the regulation pool? And I realize I think you said in the last conference call that we\'re always consider our options right now it\'s not an option we are thinking about, but how does that planning go on for that long-term sort of idea?
Peter Hancock 
Well, I think the first thing to recognize is that there is an enormous difference in this area between banks and insurance companies. There always has been but it\'s never been more stark than today. Banks have fundamentally been much less regulated than insurance companies and I\'ve worked in both sectors. And so we have roughly 200 regulators. Every U.S. state, every country we operate in and in many countries two regulators. And the system of regulation for financial services in general has obviously been severely tested by the financial crisis and there have been many reforms to try and improve it.
The creation of the SIFI designation, the creation of the G-SII designation the global systemically important insurer is another approach to modernize it, but the individual regulators in each of our jurisdictions state by state, New York state in particulate, but the FSA being converted into the PRA and the FCA in the UK, every one of these 200 regulators has been looking at what worked and what did not work in 2008. And so there is a tremendous amount of change, change in awareness or vulnerabilities, change in what institutions should do to be more transparent and how much leverage makes sense. So the good news is that compared to banks insurers are much less leveraged and we have less than 5 to 1 asset the equity ratio almost SIFI banks 12 to 15 to 1.
We have as I mentioned earlier about 140 billion of derivative notionals to SIFI banks 20 to 60 trillion. Liquidity we have long dated liabilities and more than 85% of our assets are tradable securities. Banks the reverse, they have short dated liabilities deposits and they have illiquid loans on the asset side. So whether it\'s leverage or liquidity there is a world of difference between banks and insurers and in particular this insurance SIFI and the bank SIFIs where is the complaint coming about being a SIFI most is on the bank side because they are being forced to de-lever.
We did that before 2012, so I think that we view the leverage constraint as not a big deal because we have our own true north of what level of risk makes sense, that\'s our binding constraint much more than what we think the future rules of SIFI and G-SIB maybe because those rules have been written yet. It\'s really jumping the guns and say that it\'s going be bad or good, so far it\'s been fine.
I think that the way in which the individual regulators operator both at the state level and internationally is also something we watch very closely and how having a systemic regulator helps coordinate that and that provides I think a great deal of comfort especially to foreign regulators that they\'re not going to be in a Lehman like situation where capital is transferred from oversea subsidiaries overnight because there is an enterprise-wide oversight approach to make sure that the whole company has integrity in its stress testing and so on.
So on balance I think it\'s very important in this business to have the confidence of your policyholders. We make large long-term promises as part of core business. The rating agencies who keep a watch on us as well and so I don\'t think there is anything like as much of a division of interest between creditors and shareholders in this industry than in perhaps some others. The importance of maintaining a balance sheet with a high degree of reliability through the cycles whether it be credit cycles or insurance cycles is very important to our clients.
Josh Shanker
I appreciate the answer. Why don\'t we open up to the floor? I have more questions, well right here.
Unidentified Analyst 
Hello, just given the history since 2008, do you find any government interference apart from the usual regulatory agencies in your day to day affairs at AIG? Because I think sometimes that maybe an overhang on the stock.
Peter Hancock 
I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there is any interference that I think that other companies don\xe2\x80\x99t feel in most industries. When I speak to CEOs in other industry sectors they all have a lot of engagement with the government. I think the word interference is suggesting that they are getting in the way of doing what you want to do and it\'s almost an ideological position that many people take as opposed to a pragmatic one, I am not an ideologue. I look at whether government is partnering with industries to try and get good outcomes for our clients. And for the most part I think that\xe2\x80\x99s true there is few exceptions where you have politicize factors. But for the most part I would say where we encounter government whether it\'s in Japan, the UK at the Federal level in the U.S or in the state level, we see an alignment and the benefit of having a collaborative relationship with all of the government agencies you operate with in my view far outweigh scoring points as to whether more or less government is good. We are in the business of serving our clients and rewarding our shareholders with great returns getting into an ideological battle of whether more or less governments or good things doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like a winning proposition to us. 
Unidentified Analyst
Do you see mortgage business as a core holding?
Peter Hancock 
Yes is the simple answer. But as I said earlier we look at all of our businesses through the lens of whether they will always be a co-holding. And it\'s an obvious one that could be spun or sold because the several peers that trade publicly. So it invites that question and we are always looking at good questions like that internally and from shareholders to judge what belongs together. But right now and until we decide otherwise yes it is core.

You talk about AIG being around for 95 years you hope it\'s going to be around another 95 years. Currently your ROE is 7.4% it\'s obvious that today it\'s not the same AIG as it was over 95. Could you tell us in what ways it\'s different or what was done -- there is obviously less risk taking less profitability but could you go into some of the changes? 
Peter Hancock 
Well I think that obviously 95 years is a startup company. And even relatively recently it was run to some extent like a startup company with a lot of big personalities at each level of the organization quite opportunistic and very focused on growth. 
So the 1990s was a period of rapid growth and the market put a very high multiple on the earnings based on growth expectations. And I think in hindsight there were a lot of lessons learnt that there is a phase in any given market where growth is the right thing to prioritize you\'re a first mover advantage in this all that sector whether it\'s a country where we opened insurance in many countries which would barely see in the insurance industry or products. 
But at some point when you become a dominant force of the large market share marginal growth is probably not as attractive a risk return prospect at the early part. So knowing how we set the right balance between profitability growth and risk is something that we learned and are applying in our thinking and it\'s recognizing that we need a more nuanced set of goals growth in one sector efficiency in another, de-risking in another so that the aggregate is a sustainable growth intrinsic value. 
And so we think that while that ROE number you sight 7.4 is a useful starting point for a period to period improvement as I mentioned earlier for peer to peer comparisons I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it tells you the full picture for a number of reasons including the capital gains realization that I mentioned. But we acknowledge that it should improve but we also think our cost of equity has come down dramatically and will come down even more as people realize how much we\'ve de-risked our balance sheet. We\'ve sold over 60 billion and equity like assets from the company since 2011 and so our beta should a lot lower than it appears to be and I think that should drive a lower cost of equity and we are focused on what we call the risk adjusted profit spread or rap spread which is a spread between the ROE and our cost of equity. And we want to have a sustainably positive rap spread through time and that\xe2\x80\x99s how we think about our business. 
Now that means that we will not just simply pursue the highest ROE business. AerCap which we announced the sale of is our highest ROE business we just sold it but it\'s non-core to insurance, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very high beta business compared to life insurance. So we used a differential cost of equity as we evaluate the rap of each of our lines of business. This was not the way we evaluated businesses in the past, we prioritize growth, we prioritize ROE and we\xe2\x80\x99re now more balanced and look at the risk profile and other dimensions of value.
Unidentified Analyst
Given your background in risk, how do you kind of think about the tail risk involved of the adverse verdict in the Greenberg Lawsuit given the kind of unique nature of AIG\'s relationship with the government since 2008?
Peter Hancock
Well, we talk about that in our 10-K, I am not a lawyer, but as I see it it\'s a compound problem there\'s the first verdict that will arrive quite soon and that could go either way in terms of for Starr or for the government. Then is the question of the damages if any, then the likelihood is a first level of appeal then a final level of appeal. So you\xe2\x80\x99ve got three outcomes that could go either way and the damage amount in each case. 
And then on top of that the compound risk of whether the government would seek to get restitution through that indemnity from us and that then is effected by the arguments that each of the judges might have along that journey as to the grounds for the case going in favor of Starr and so if the grounds are ones that would nullify the indemnity that would make that indemnity less of a concern.
So as we think about those probabilities together, we come up with an assessment of whether this is a cause for concern, which other way is not going to be result for many years. So it\'s not an immediate liquidity event, but from a valuation point of view, that\xe2\x80\x99s the framework we use and I think you have as much information the public domain just sign your own probabilities to each of those elements to come up with as good a guess as we have.

Wanted to ask about the P&C pricing environment, so I think over the last few years AIG has generally outperformed its peer group by having better pricing growth, what are the key drivers for that outperformance and you see them persisting for how long?
Peter Hancock
Well, as I have tried to indicate, we have been very disciplined about getting this balance between profitability, growth and risk and that\xe2\x80\x99s right down to the individual desk level where people are budgeting in terms of marginal rap rather than in premium. And so in the past if you were trying to hit a premium target in your budget as of softening in pricing happened, you might keep on writing business. We take away that incentive to keep on writing if the pricing environment diminishes and we\'ll reallocate that capital elsewhere in the business. 
To give you an example, we have been writing a lot less U.S. property cat because the pricing environment has been severely impacted by lower prices in the reinsurance market, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve been growing our international property, in particular the highly engineered property where we\xe2\x80\x99re getting well paid for the expertise that we provide to do the highly engineered property underwriting.
And we\xe2\x80\x99ve recruited over 500 engineers over the last three years, that\xe2\x80\x99s a very value added service that makes us a potent competitor to companies like SMGlobal that are really providing highly engineered property underwriting on an international basis. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve changed our governance in a way that has one person look at our global property business George Stratts who can deploy our capacity wherever our clients need it as opposed to a more historical approach where the local management would have had their own risk appetite limit our willingness to deploy capital locally based on their local P&L. We now mutualize that globally which gives us the ability to operate like the large company that we are.
So bottom line as pricing deteriorates in one market or improves in another, we really are quite conscious about shifting our capital to where it\'s best rewarded and if it\'s not been rewarded well at all, the numbers that Josh mentioned earlier in terms of surplus capital that will go back up and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking to buyback more shares. So we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to just blindly deploy our capital in a softening market is the simple answer to your question.

Thanks and we\xe2\x80\x99re out of time, so please join me in giving Peter and -- I believe there is lunch available probably about now too so if you\'re hungry, you can do that. Take care. Thanks Peter appreciate it.
