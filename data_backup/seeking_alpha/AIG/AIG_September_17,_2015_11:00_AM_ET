Jay Gelb - Barclays
Jay Gelb
Good afternoon everyone. I am Jay Gelb, the U.S. Insurance Analyst at Barclays. The format of this track will be a fireside chat with David Herzog of AIG, who we are very pleased to have with us. David is AIG\'s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. He successfully led the financial functions of AIG during its substantial restructuring and repayment of U.S. government funds. AIG is among the world\'s largest property casualty insurers and also has this substantial U.S. life insurance for retirement and savings business. David, thank you for joining us today.
David Herzog
Thank you. Thanks for having us and thanks everybody for coming today.
Q - Jay Gelb
So let\'s start off with the big picture on AIG. What\'s your perspective on where AIG is now strategically and financially, and where is it headed?
David Herzog
Thanks. You know, really from a couple of different perspectives in terms of financial strength and then we could talk about where we are at strategically, we are starting from today, a position of real strength, strength of the balance sheet, the liquidity. Still have -- there is still work to do on the infrastructure, but we have come an awful long way. Our operating companies, which are really at the core of the franchise, are very well capitalized, well positioned, and what we have done is establish a very good discipline to move capital around inside the company, to really improve the fungibility of capital and we have got much greater insights into the resiliency of capital liquidity. And we talked about that, I am sure, in term of how that has come about.
Our capital position is strong, our leverage is in a very good shape. We are a little over 16% debt-to-total capitalization, which when we started this journey, was quite a bit higher than that. So we have been very successful -- the team has been very successful at giving us -- putting us in a position of strength and flexibility, which is good.
From a strategic standpoint and an overview standpoint, Peter is coming up on his one year of being the CEO in the seat. He is taking a very -- I think a very thoughtful and deliberate approach engaged in a strategy dialog with our board. I think his shareholder letter was very telling in terms of how he is thinking about the business, Peter thinks about and has brought with him, a perspective of -- and a balance of growth, profitability and risk and I think we are bringing that -- those concepts to bear, as we think about strategy and talked a little bit about sculpting of the business in certain, whether its activities or businesses that may not be the best fit for our company going forward. Again, that\'s part of the dialog that we are having with the board.
So I think from a strategy standpoint, we have got a good -- again, a good sound financial position from which to build on, and a clear line of sight and a good process, a supportive dialog with the board about the strategy, where we are going to compete, how we are going to compete. I think the other thing that\'s really important, is the ongoing buildout of our data and our science team that the use of data science to help shape how we underwrite, how we think about the business, how we serve our clients, is a very important and growing capability in the firm. So the function itself is relatively new to AIG, but it\'s an important part of how we see innovation coming to our firm. It doesn\'t have an exclusive on innovation, but it is certainly a catalyst for the partners with the business.
Jay Gelb
It\xe2\x80\x99s a very helpful start in terms of framing the business. Let\'s talk about the property casualty operation. One question I often get from investors is, how AIG could further improve the underlying accident year property-casualty underwriting results. It might not be at top-tier levels yet. So what can AIG do to improve those?
David Herzog
It is a journey that we are on. I think John Doyle, who runs our commercial insurance businesses talked a bit about it in the recent earnings call, that we continue to strive for sustainable improvement in the underlying profitability and it starts with the loss ratio, the accident year loss ratio, and the improvements that we are making. And it\'s driven -- John drives it really through the business mix, where we are competing, how we are competing, where we see advantage, where we see pricing opportunities. The shift in emphasis from premium volume to the value of business that we are producing in writing, and the focus on risk adjusted profitability, was an integral part of actually giving people the tools and the framework for making rational choices about how you assess whether or not you want to write piece of business. Historically, we would have written volume for the sake of volume, not being critical. In the past, we\'d never do that, it\'s just a statement of perspective. But now we reward people for writing profitable business.
And so on the margin, or on an incremental decision, if we can\'t cover attrition or loss, we can\'t cover the losses that you believe, based upon, again, a growing level of science and data. It gives people the courage to not write a piece of business, and again, that coupled with more dynamic capital allocation, we then will redeploy the capital elsewhere in the business or will get it up for the holding company, which we have been pretty effective at doing.
So the business mix shift is a big part of it, and John\'s team and the science team have developed quality indices around accounts, quality indices around brokers, and so the -- in terms of the quality of business, the predictive analytics around us making better underwriting choices. Again, there is no one easy lever to pull, but it really is at the forefront. It really is at -- where we face off with our clients.
I think one of the other big investment areas that are paying off in a very meaningful way are around claims and claims management. The consistency of capturing claims data across the firm, I think Peter and John have talked about, we pay something like 1 million claims a month, which equates to about $120 million plus a day, so its big money. And not only its just big money, there is a lot of data, that comes with that, and so its about capturing the data, and capturing it once right, the first time upfront, in a way that is usable, and that it could be accessed across the firm. And those are tools that are new, and will help drive the profitability of that business.
Again, what John sees, and I think there is a reason to believe, there is a -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a gradual journey. It\xe2\x80\x99s a one to two points a year, we were a little short of that in the first half. John sees it with the other pricing environments and where we are growing and whether that\'s in the financial lines, the M&A book, our international property book has been a big important growth engine for us. It tends to have, maybe not as much the capped pricing sensitivity like you see here in the U.S.
So we have reoriented how we run many of our lines of business, for example, property. That one is a global book, and as opposed to a collection of books that were written across various countries. And so, that has enabled us to invest in the kind of engineering centers and the engineering expertise that not only helps us make better underwriting decisions, but also helps our client mitigate loss to the extent we can. So those are some of the big tools and some of the big levers that John and the team are pulling.
Jay Gelb
Thanks David. AIG\'s property casualty reserves have had to deal with some consistent, although modest reserve strengthening. Why is that, and when do you think that trend could change for the better?
David Herzog
Reserves have been a point of great deal of focus outside the company and inside the company as well. We do make our best estimate, based upon the -- all the available data. We look at the -- all of the longtailed complex lines of business. Serves about $45 billion or so of reserves, something in that order of magnitude. And we look at every one of these lines of business in detail, we call them deep dives, detailed valuation reviews, and we go deep. And we avail ourselves of all sorts of subject matter experts inside and outside of the company, and as data emerges, we look at it as wholesome away, as one could possibly look at it.
So we do have a [indiscernible] we make our best calls. This last quarter, I think we were disappointed with the emergence in our commercial trucking business. But the team -- we have taken a hard look. We tend to -- in some of these areas, tend to participate in excess layers, so the emergence may not be as fast, or as quickly as in some of more lower tranches of risk towers. And again, we took a hard look, took a step back, looked at the why and why-now, and to satisfy ourselves that we are not over or under reacting to it. And I think the philosophy is to get it right, get it down the middle, have pluses and minuses and even with the net adverse developments, there is still pluses and minuses that have taken place, and we have had some adverse -- particularly in some of the older accident years that we have dealt with and will continue to do so. But we will try to get it right, so we can take some of that noise out of the system.
Jay Gelb
The reserve mix appears to be shifting, as those older accident years get paid off, and the newer accident year has become a bigger portion of the reserve base. Should that help address the issue, mathematically?
David Herzog
Yes, and it does and it should. And part of that, even some of the older accident years for example, in the workers compensation book, and this was a line of business that is -- it is complex, and its highly regulated and it is competitive. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a vital part of the coverage that our clients need. And so, this was a -- and its an area where science, technology, data, lend itself to help better inform not just actuarial judgments, but also have helped bridge not just reserves, but to help bridge claims mitigation, coming up with claim settlement strategies that have been A, developed; B, been able to then quantified and push down to people that are accountable for specific results and specific quarters, so that we can track progress against initiatives that again, years ago, didn\'t exist. Now they not only exist, but they are measured in track, and we can monitor progress against those.
So its the use of data and the sciences and bridging across longevity risk, a good example. We have longevity risk in several parts of our product portfolios, whether that\'s in workers compensation, whether that\'s internal funding and the likes, or in some of the pension buyout business. So you have those same risks, and we have subject matter experts, and with the way the company is being run, we make much better use of internal subject matter experts. And so, we will continue to improve on it, we will continue to leverage the learnings that we are getting out of -- what started with a desire to make better, more informed reserve judgments, actually now helping guide how we actually run the business and risk selection and claims management.
Jay Gelb
A near term topic that we have all been hearing about, is the port explosion in Tianjin, China on August 12. Outside observers have sized this a potentially a $3 billion loss for the insurance industry or probably larger. Any perspective on what AIG\'s exposure might be, at this early stage?
David Herzog
We do have commercial exposure in China, so we do have both companies inside China and in our multinational book. But we don\'t comment on specific losses, we will cover it to the extent. Its appropriate we will cover that often in the third quarter. But we do have exposure there. We do have clients that have losses there.
Jay Gelb
Directionally, do you think its within the realm of a typical large loss?
David Herzog
Yeah. Its hard for me to comment on it, till I see more data and see -- as we run through -- across some of those areas. What happens in many large complex claims, data is maybe not as quick to come to the fore. And so, we will be thorough, as we think through, A, what our exposure is, and B, what we think about how we reserve for that.
Jay Gelb
Let\'s turn to AIG\'s U.S. life and retirements savings business. The first thing I\'d like to focus on is, how is AIG addressing the impact of sustaining low interest rates in the life and retirement savings operation?
David Herzog
Obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s a challenging environment for long term savers in our economy. It is a challenge. But that said, we have been and remain very disciplined on new business that we write. We have a developing, but reasonably well developed framework for looking at profitability of new business. We look at the value of new business, we look at the cost of capital associated with various product lines. So we are very focused on maintaining our margins on new business. We filed products with much lower guarantees and where we have repriced. So for example, in our fixed annuity book, reprice is literally weekly and its done so with an eye towards maintaining a return.
We have been very disciplined about not overemphasizing, not growing that business. Not so much that we couldn\'t earn our cost of capital on that business today, we can, we are. But rather, with this level of nominal interest rates, we have been cautious about not overbuilding a book of business that would exacerbate a disintermediation risk for the firm. And so, there will come a point in time, when the macro demand for that product, fixed annuities, is a -- will become much more robust. So a 10-year rate, approaching 3%, we have seen historically that spurs demand, macro demand. And so, it really is around pricing. And also pricing discipline on reset, when the annuities come up for their window renewals, and we reset -- we have been very disciplined about moving interest rates to the extent we can. You move them, in many cases, down to their minimum. So I think its roughly about 70% or so of that book is added to minimum guarantee.
We are still making money, we are still making a spread on it, but we have been disciplined about bringing down the rates. But again, it gets back to a broader product mix, our variable annuity business continues to be very attractive. We have a broad distribution platform and the products. We were not major players in the variable annuity space during the early days, and maybe some of the -- or some of the benefits may not have been priced exactly right. And so our back book is really fairly modest, but the product features, the risk management that goes into the product design. The best risk management variable annuity is at the design table, not once you have it on the books. And so the team has been very careful about growing.
Its an implicit. People are worried about outliving their income, and that product set serves a very specific and important need for clients. And so, again, having that products and having good quality distribution is an important part of that. So we have been, again, going at it in a very balanced way.
Jay Gelb
Thank you for that. Let\'s turn to capital management dividend. This is a real important focus area for investors. AIG has been a substantial repurchaser of its shares and recently doubled the dividend. How should we think about the pace of buybacks going forward, especially taking into account the proceeds from the sale of the aircraft leasing business, ILFC to AerCap?
David Herzog
It is one of the most important levers. Not the most, but its one of the most important levers we have for creating value is how we deploy capital. So we have a framework that we engage with our board, and the dialog we have with our Board about how and where and what quantum to deploy capital. We always look for organic opportunities and we generate sufficient capital. We will look from time to time at organic opportunities that enhance a capability, enhance a skill, bring us something that is easier bought than built. But generally speaking, inorganic are acquisitions that are not capital intensive.
So they are not necessarily transformative. We have purchased a number of -- for us, a relatively small companies. They have been very important acquisitions for the respective local businesses. So the [indiscernible] acquisition we did was very important for that business. But it wasn\'t transformative for AIG. But terrific for that particular country.
So then we think about capital deployment and share buyback, and with the sources of capital come from some pretty well defined, well established sources inside the firm, that the dividends distribution is up from the operating companies, the monetization of our deferred tax asset, which comes to being in respect of the tax sharing payments that are made from the operating companies and for the holding company, and then when we file our tax returns, we are utilizing, then operating loss carry forwards or foreign tax credits. And so that\'s a real tangible source of cash that comes up from the operating companies. And then the monetization of the non-core assets, which is what you refer to.
The capital planning process, we have a plan, we have a policy, we have a plan. We review with our Board. The Fed, they review our process, but they don\'t review or approve our plan. And so as we generate deployable capital, we then -- again, enter in that dialog in -- either incorporate what we have done into the then current plan, or in this case, with the $5 billion of additional authorization that we sought and was approved by our Board. It was on the basis of -- we had a material monetization of the AerCap shares. A material monetization of a portion of our PICC shares, which is a -- so that has been a terrific relationship, it had appreciate to a great extent, and we wanted to take some money of the table and diversify a bit. But its still a wonderful relationship, and we value it greatly. We had some other -- Springleaf, which is up for sale, the remnants of one of the divestitures we had done back in the restructuring.
Those are the things that had occurred. But none of those had been incorporated into the plan, the original plan. And there is methodologies to that, because what you don\'t want to do, is plan on a monetization, incorporate your capital actions, and then -- so you build a plan that\'s based on contingent funding, that is not a formula for success by the Fed or frankly by our board. We are much more prudent about that.
So we will continue to deploy those authorizations. You have seen our past practice of getting an authorization and then, in fairly short order deploying it. I would expect that, and Peter commented on the call that later have it utilized by the end of the year or shortly thereafter and I think that\'s an appropriate framework for how we think about it.
Jay Gelb
How much you have left in the current --
David Herzog
As of June 30, which is really all I can just comment at this point. We have six point of the entire $11 billion that we had authorized for the year. We had $6.3 billion remaining, as of -- I think it was as of June 30. Maybe that was as of the time we released earnings. I think it was as of the time we released earnings in early August. So $6.3 billion; and it will be that $6.3 billion that we utilize between here and either the end of the year, or shortly thereafter. Maybe it spills over into the early part of 2016.
But its all facts and circumstances based. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dynamic capital model that we use to decide how quickly and when. But we are deploying. We will deploy, and that\'s why we had it. That\'s why we sought to generate the capital and then get it deployed.
Jay Gelb
I think that was very much welcome, especially with the stock trading at 80% of book value?
David Herzog
Well we are aligned. I mean, we see it in a similar way, when we are trading below one\'s view of value, whether that\'s a view of book value, whether that\'s adjusted book value, whether its\' a range of intrinsic value, when its trading at a discount to that, or an attractive level to that, it becomes a compelling use of capital.
Jay Gelb
Okay. AIG has been designated a non-bank sifi, which means its regulated by the Federal Reserve. What are your expectations for the non-bank sifi rules and the potential impact on AIG?
David Herzog
Its interesting. Our relationship with the Fed has been -- first and foremost, been constructive. Both on our side with the Fed, and I think with every interaction I have ever had with varying parts of the Fed, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the New York Fed or the people at the Washington Fed. So it is constructive.
Today they are -- I would characterize them as our supervisor; because there aren\'t rules. So the regulators, when there is a set of capital rules and supervisory rules that have been issued. So they are in the process of developing capital standards. And we like other market participants that are similarly designated, are working to try to educate the Fed, and come up with a sensible standard. The amendment to the [indiscernible], made it possible that the Fed can differentiate banks and insurance companies. And I am encouraged, I am heartened that my conversations with the Fed, they acknowledge that banks and insurance companies are different.
Their balance sheets and the balance sheet philosophy is different, and therefore the capital framework and rules should likewise be different. And so they have a challenge, because they have -- they have to come up with a standard, that is appropriate and manageable by companies that do not file regularly, U.S. GAAP financial statements. Today, when the banks are regulated, they are regulated on a U.S. GAAP basis, and the new challenge is, that the Fed has got to come up with a capital standard that\'s adaptable by not only those of us that are U.S. GAAP filers, but those insurance bank holding company, or a thrift holding company, institutions that are not U.S. GAAP filers.
And so, we are coming up, we are helping give constructive feedback on what kind of standard that might be, what might that look like, how might that work. But in the meantime, Jay, we continue to do -- we are operating a company really according to our own true North. We run stress tests, we update those stress tests, its on a U.S. GAAP basis. Solvency, we look at solvency, we look at liquidity, we look for the binding constraint in the system, so to speak. So that\'s one of the lessons learned from 2008, was that you can have plenty of capital, maybe on a consolidated basis. But if you don\'t have the capital in the right place at the right time, in the right economic circumstance, you could find yourself in a bit of a problem.
So we have our own true north, we continue to develop that true north, building out the infrastructure, the robustness of the test, because its -- what I have learned is that it goes beyond just the numbers. Its not just the quantitative test. Its very important. I think the Fed sees it as, what\'s our process, what\'s our control, what\'s the level of dialog and challenge and review both internally and with our board. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a learning process. I am glad we started early, and have continued to build out that discipline and build out the infrastructure, because its important.
We want to be ready. Whatever the standard is, and whenever it becomes applicable for them to become our regulator, we want to be ready.
Jay Gelb
And in terms of the timing on that, either for the rules or the initial stress tests for the non-bank sifis?
David Herzog
Not that I would place any real weight on. Its best I understand that there is going to be a process. The rules will be drafted.
They will be released. We will have a chance to comment. They will review our comments, and those have -- again, other market participants. I would expect there to be some type of quantitative impact, study or field tests, so that they understand the possible implications of what the rules might be.
And then, once the rules are finalized, it\xe2\x80\x99s then the following year that they become applicable. So there is a process to go through. I wouldn\'t expect the rules to be finalized this year, so does that then translate into a 2017 that the -- its conjecture on my part, just I am telling you from the perch I sit, and that\'s kind of how it looks.
Jay Gelb
2017 for a stress test?
David Herzog
Yes, I think so. But in the meantime, we continue to run our own true North, and we go through quite a bit of rigor. Our Board puts forth very high standards on us, and we have that dialog with them. And frankly, on ourselves, our own true north. I mean, we take a lot of pride in the resiliency of the firm, and want to make sure we are ready. So again, the whole idea is, to run the tests and operate the company, such that when the rules are finally formalized and applicable, that there is not some sea change in how we are running the company. So that it\'s as seamless as possible.
There is no question there is going to be a lot of work to do. But the whole idea is that the fundamental operating parameters of the firm, are as best we can have them at the time that rules become effective.
Jay Gelb
Thank you for that. The next topic I want to focus in on, is return on equity. AIG\'s operating return on equity in the first half of 2015, excluding AOCI was essentially unrealized fixed income gains, and a deferred tax asset was 9.3%, or if we look at it on a normalized basis, it was 6.7%. This result is below many property casualty and life insurance peers.
If you look at over the next few years, what do you think a reasonable expectation should be for AIG\'s return on equity?
David Herzog
We tried to come up with a normalization of our ROE, and we have an operating income definition that has been very consistent, and there were some items of variability or volatility that will occur from quarter-to-quarter. So we tried to put out a \'normalized\' for that. And so as a benchmark or baseline for us to measure our progress on the fundamentals, and so the baseline which was 7.4 and I think the first half of the year was somewhere around 7.3, I think the first half is as much for us to measure our progress against ourselves, not so much as a measure of -- what that number is against somebody else\'s non-normalized number.
We also, just as a point of fact, we had done quite a bit of capital gains harvesting in the past, because we had some very valuable tax attributes and capital loss carry forwards. And so in certain targeted books of business, we harvested capital gains, which is good for all of us, our shareholders, because we capture quite a bit of economic value in doing so. Now the consequence for that, is that our GAAP reported operating income is hurt, because of the reinvestment in lower rate. So there is about 70-80 basis point headwind on that. We did not adjust for that. So it\xe2\x80\x99s just a simple fact.
We have laid out a goal objective of improving ROE, 50 basis points a year for the next three years off that baseline. Again, as a measure of improvement of the underlying fundamentals, and again the key levers to that, obviously there is a lot of leverage in improving the underlying profitability of our commercial insurance business. Essentially one point of combined ratio improvement equates to about $200 million a year in pre-tax earnings, and so there is the loss ratio improvement and expenses, which is a nice segue to why the second goal and objective that we laid out is an improvement in our general operating expense levels across the firm, that we have laid out a 3% or 5% net improvement in operating expenses, each of the next -- including 2015, 2016, and 2017. And there a number of program of work, that is well underway across the firm. Its not going to be 3% to 5%, I call it mayonnaised across evenly across the firm, but it will be done in a very targeted way.
And so that\'s a big lever, because our operating expenses, total about -- 2014 was just shy of $12 billion worth of operating expenses across the whole firm. So again, that\'s a big lever, and so there is -- like I say, there is a broad commitment to that. We are all tied together -- our incentive programs and all of the -- our performance, my performance, Peter\'s performance, the entire team\'s performance will be judged on how well we manage. Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a straight line, its not like clipping coupons, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a body of work. We announced recently we made some important changes to some of the benefit programs of the firm. We didn\'t quantify that, but obviously, that was a meaningful step and that\'s just one of many-many areas where there is plenty of opportunity to improve the efficiency of the firm.
Jay Gelb
Right. So 50 basis point target improvement and return on equity for each of the next three years, was a starting point of where?
David Herzog
Well, we said the 7.4 based on the normalizations that we had done. And so, what\'s interesting, we had the timing of AerCap for example, it was a high ROE asset, but nonetheless, I would just say, no regrets on having sold it. It was a non-core asset, and I think we made -- the team clearly made the right choice. So it\xe2\x80\x99s off to 7.4, and we will go from there. We will have headwinds from time to time in AerCap, in terms of an ROE progression, is clearly a headwind on 30 odd basis points. But that\'s our goal.
Jay Gelb
Okay. So 2017, hopefully targeting around 9%. Normalized, to me, that\'s pretty close to 10. That puts you in a pretty good spot, especially with a place to book multiple on the stock currently?
David Herzog
And it\xe2\x80\x99s as much about managing or trying to influence the cost of capital, because it is the absolute return on capital. We have done an awful lot to derisk appropriately derisk the firm. We have to take risk to make money. But it is about managing both the cost of risk, and managing our return on the capital that we have deployed.
Jay Gelb
I am afraid, we are essentially out of time. Are there any final thoughts you\'d like to leave the group with?
David Herzog
No. I think you have hit on the right topics. I appreciate.
Jay Gelb
Please join me in thanking Dave Herzog from AIG. Thanks so much.
