Rob Schimek - Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer, Commercial
Analysts
Jay Gelb - Barclays
Jay Gelb
Alright. Good morning, everyone. I am Jay Gelb from Barclays. Thanks everyone for joining us over the next several days for the 14th Annual Barclays Global Financial Services Conference. I am the senior analyst covering the U.S. property, casualty, and life insurance industries and I am very pleased with us to have today Rob Schimek from AIG.
AIG is among the largest property casualty insurers and also had the substantial U.S. life insurance and retirement savings business. Rob is AIG\xe2\x80\x99s Executive Vice President and CEO of the commercial insurance unit. Prior to his current role, Rob has served as AIG\xe2\x80\x99s CEO of the Americas, CEO of EMEA, and CFO of AIG\xe2\x80\x99s global property casualty business.
Before joining AIG, Rob was a partner with Deloitte & Touche. Rob, thanks again for joining us today.
Rob Schimek
My pleasure, Jay.
Jay Gelb
You were recently promoted to be Head of AIG\xe2\x80\x99s commercial insurance business. What\xe2\x80\x99s been your strategy to improve results and how would you characterize performance so far?
Rob Schimek
So, we outlined a strategy on January 26. A copy of that strategy, by the way, is on the AIG webpage for everyone to see. And as it relates to the commercial insurance business, we articulated the strategy to move our adjusted accident year loss ratio down by 6 points between the beginning of 2016 and the end of 2017, so over a 2-year period. One an important point is that we wanted to make sure people understood how confident we were in our ability to do that. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a back-end loaded plan. As a matter of fact, our plan delivers 4 points of the 6 point reduction in the adjusted accident year loss ratio here in 2016 with the remaining 2 points in 2017.
The strategy really focuses around fundamentally three things. There is five components, but I can summarize it for you in three pieces. The first is the use of reinsurance and other risk mitigation tools like reinsurance to improve the loss ratio. The second is narrowing our focus, and narrowing our focus means narrowing our focus with respect to which clients we focus on. Our vision at AIG is to be our clients\xe2\x80\x99 most valued insurer, but clients where we only have a one-product or a two-product relationship is not really necessarily consistent with our view of becoming a holistic trading partner with those clients. And so, we want to either expand that relationship or if it\xe2\x80\x99s not profitable, just end the relationship. So, that would be narrowing our focus with respect to mono line or dual line clients is what refer to it.
The second element of narrowing our focus is narrowing our focus with respect to which products we offer, and so there are some products that we have exited, and in particular, here in the United States and Canada, we exited two lines of business, one in the environmental area known as pollution legal liability, solely in the United States and Canada. And the other is a line of business we refer to as buffer trucking and that\xe2\x80\x99s a casualty layer of protection for long-haul truckers. Fundamentally, those two lines of business represent about 2.5% of AIG\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio, but represented a very outsized portion of the amount of losses that we incur. And so we decided to narrow our focus with respect to their products. And then lastly, we have \xe2\x80\x93 we are really focusing on narrowing our focus with respect to geography. So, we serve clients in total in over 200 countries and jurisdictions, but we have AIG operations in over 90 countries, and we simply can\xe2\x80\x99t be all things to all clients in all geographies, and so narrowing our focus. So, the first element was reinsurance. The second element was narrowing our focus. And then the third piece of the strategy is really focused around segmentation, just micro-segmentation, get really down to the very detailed level to make decisions about which clients you want to be in and in which places you want to serve those clients. And so, we refer to that as micro-segmentation. It uses both internal and external data to do a better job with respect to risk selection. Those things in total, I would say, were the plan we outlined during January 26. I think our performance year-to-date demonstrates that we have been doing a very good job with respect to executing.
Jay Gelb
I would agree with that, Rob. I mean, there has been a clear trend of improvement. The underlying loss ratio over the past two quarters, oftentimes the question I get is, well, is this a bit more front-loaded than you would have thought, and do you still think we can see improvement come through over the course of this year and next year?
Rob Schimek
Yes, I will reiterate that we are absolutely confident that we will deliver the 6 points of improvement over the 2-year period as we outlined in our strategy to the extent that it has felt more front-end loaded. I would say that there is a very interesting dynamic that I think plays out here and that is people who doubted our ability to execute the strategy generally, said, well, look, market conditions will be wind in your face. It will make it more difficult to execute the strategy. And I would actually just observe that in some ways, the soft market conditions have actually been a help to us in implementing our strategy. So, I am not sure that I would say that we will deliver anymore than the 6 points of improvement, but the ability to get there faster is helped by the fact that while we are practicing very careful restraint in the market, there is a lot of other competitors who have not been. And so when we want to exit a single product in a multi-line product relationship, we can constructively work through with the broker and with the client how to make that change. And we found that competitors have been very happy to take that piece of business from AIG, a piece of business that we have had for a long time that we know really well and that we know on its own is not a profitable piece of business. So, I think the soft market conditions have actually, in some ways, been wind in our back and not wind in our face.
Jay Gelb
That\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting dynamic. I mean, I would have thought with the soft commercial insurance market persisting for the past several years is that will be a headwind on margin improvement. What you are saying is because that business can be shifted to competitors given their hunger for growth that becomes less of an issue?
Rob Schimek
Yes, I might describe the situation as saying if you want to change your mix of business, when market conditions are soft, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good time to change your mix business. And the reason is if I were trying to shed a particular product, I can do that without horribly disrupting my client relationship or my broker relationship and that helps me to optimize my mix of business. Obviously, soft rates impact all of our lines of business. And so in that area, I would say it is wind in our face, but generally speaking, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably been more wind in our back where we have been able to improve the mix of business than it\xe2\x80\x99s been wind in our face.
Jay Gelb
So, that kind of leaves one of the concerns that was probably raised initially when AIG was exiting lines of business or certain geographies, is there a risk of AIG losing profitable customers as it exits these areas, where they might buy one of those unprofitable lines, but overall, is it a profitable relationship that\xe2\x80\x99s at risk?
Rob Schimek
Yes. So, we are very pleased with our retention of client relationships. So year-to-date, we have retained 94% of our major account relationships and that\xe2\x80\x99s in an environment where we have had a much larger than a 6% decline in overall premium. So, what you can see is that we have been able to reduce the premium writings in those more challenged lines without disrupting the broader client relationship. With that said, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just so important to remember that we are here for the purpose of serving those clients. And so the reason that our client relationships have been able to be retained is because we focus on what are the other differentiating characteristics of AIG that we can bring to the table. Are there capabilities that enable us to say, this is why AIG is different than our competitors? And so therefore, while we want to maybe change our mix of business in an area, you should be very happy to continue to maintain your long-term relationship with AIG. And to-date, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been very successful.
Jay Gelb
Okay. AIG\xe2\x80\x99s commercial property casualty insurance top line has declined significantly. I believe it was down 18% in the first half of 2016 on a year-over-year basis, what\xe2\x80\x99s driving this trend, which seems to be a larger decline in the broader market and why could premium volume cap stabilize?
Rob Schimek
Yes. So let me take the second quarter, the results that we posted most recently as a case in point. So we declined and managed to see our premium volume there decline by about 20% in the second quarter from the \xe2\x80\x93 in the second quarter of 2016 versus the second quarter of 2015. But I would say that this was part of our active management strategy, that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s so important. About half of the reduction in premium was attributable to a combination of our reinsurance activities, which fundamentally mean we are still writing the business. We are just not retaining it net on AIG\xe2\x80\x99s books. As well as the exits where we have decided that that\xe2\x80\x99s just a line of business that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense for AIG to continue to focus on, as I described narrowing our focus earlier and rate declines. I would say about half of the 10 points relates to those three factors. It was the use of reinsurance is about 6 points. The reduction associated with the exits, you could \xe2\x80\x93 consider to be about 2 points. And the global rate decline for us about 1 point. That leaves about 10 points of our reduction in premium volume in Q2 to be attributable to really the micro-segmentation, risk selection activities that we have undertaken. And so, I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s been the driver. My view is that for the full year, premium volumes will be down about $3 billion on our starting point of $20 billion, so down about 15% for the year. And attributable, generally speaking to the factors that I just outlined. I think for 2017 and 2018 and beyond, really the market conditions will dictate for us where we have the opportunities to grow. What I can absolutely reinforce is that there are parts of this business that we really want to grow and we are having success in growing. We find growth in the mergers and acquisitions space, in the cyber space. We are seeing growth in our middle market property, which is in engineered property portfolio, and of course, in a very important part of the AIG business, which is our multinational portfolio. So we see great opportunities to grow in some places, but the market conditions will dictate for us whether we see additional opportunities to grow or whether we see additional opportunities to reshape the portfolio with our primary focus being on value creation.
Jay Gelb
In that comment on 2017 and beyond, having top line growth being driven more by market opportunity, does that mean that AIG has completed its view of major transitions in the reinsurance buying patterns?
Rob Schimek
I think the vast majority of our reinsurance transactions that we wanted to implement over the course of the 2-year strategy period that we outlined on January 26, we have largely been able to implement. We will continue to be opportunistic. So you will see where we have tested the reinsurance market and maybe the market is not interested in something we want to do. I look at that as healthy. We are testing the market. We think we are offering things to the market that should be a good deal between us and the reinsurance market. With that said, we recognized the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s a two way street. This has to be something that works for us as well as for the re-insurer. And even though it may look good in my eyes, it may not look as good in the re-insurer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. So generally speaking, I think we have executed the transactions we need to and intended to execute, but we will continue to opportunistically look for places to even furthermore \xe2\x80\x93 more further optimize the reinsurance buying decisions.
Jay Gelb
Alright. So even though there might be some stabilization on a gross written premium basis in 2017 and beyond, taking into account of perhaps buying more reinsurance, we should expect some still downward trend in volume over the next couple of years, but at a slower pace?
Rob Schimek
That\xe2\x80\x99s right.
Jay Gelb
Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s helpful. Thanks Rob. Let\xe2\x80\x99s touch based on expense savings, can you give us an overview of your expense savings targets in commercial insurance and how it will be achieved?
Rob Schimek
So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to begin on expenses by saying that this is bigger than a commercial insurance activity. It\xe2\x80\x99s actually an AIG-wide effort. And I think that, that\xe2\x80\x99s really important because the AIG organization is very interconnected and it\xe2\x80\x99s important to me that other parts of the organization are working as hard as we are in the commercial insurance to make sure that we are making operational improvements and improving the efficiency. We have outlined again in our strategy presentation for January 26 that we intend this year to improve our expenses by about $700 million. I think for the first six months of the year, we surely have demonstrated that we are at least on track for that $700 million improvement in expenses. The commercial insurance expense reductions are just a piece of that overall $700 million improvement in expenses, but again we benefit in commercial from everyone\xe2\x80\x99s improvement in expenses because some of those expenses are allocated to us from other parts of the AIG operation. So what I think is really important is in order to reshape the portfolio and in order to have the conviction and the courage to shrink, if we need to shrink to really get this portfolio to its optimal mix of business and its optimal profitability sort of targets, we have to be confident that we don\xe2\x80\x99t shrink the portfolio, improve the loss ratio, but see our expense ratio ballooning back up and so that we have improving loss ratio but a deteriorating expense ratio. That\xe2\x80\x99s not really achieving the objective. What I am really proud of is that we have demonstrated that we are heading in the same direction on both. We have continued to believe that the improvement in our loss ratio will not be given up in a deterioration of the expense ratio and that\xe2\x80\x99s because of the holistic efforts of AIG across the commercial insurance business, but across the rest of the organization.
Jay Gelb
So that seems to signal that any of the announced or achieved expense savings are going to nearly all dropped to the bottom line?
Rob Schimek
I think that the expense savings will also be used to make sure that we can fund investments for future success of the organization. So you will see AIG continuing to invest in innovation, continuing to invest in technology, continuing to invest in what we refer to as the science part of the organization. So I think our expense reductions fuel the future of AIG through those investments in technology, in science, in data as well as enable us to have the conviction to shrink the portfolio and see the loss ratio not be offset by increases in the expense ratio, which does mean that much of that loss ratio or those loss or those expense reductions will flow through to the bottom line.
Jay Gelb
Okay. That\xe2\x80\x99s great. The \xe2\x80\x93 a question I often get about AIG\xe2\x80\x99s commercial insurance business is the reserve position, AIG took a substantial $3.6 billion reserve charge at the end of 2015, how can investors or other external observers have confidence that another reserve charge won\xe2\x80\x99t be needed?
Rob Schimek
So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to refer you back to the comments that our CFO, Sid Sankaran, made both in the January 26 strategy presentation as well as in our year end earnings release. And so if you get the opportunity, I had to go back and read those because I think they are extremely helpful. But one key point that I wanted to make is that we have continued to address focusing our resources, not only around what is the central point estimate for our reserves, but spending a lot of time trying to figure out what\xe2\x80\x99s the level of volatility we can expect around that central point estimate. And we put more and more resources around having greater conviction around the volatility, around our best estimate assumption. But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s really important to emphasize that we rate many long-tail lines of business. We rate business in many geographies around the world and we are subject to regulatory changes, random court decisions, to the short temperature in those countries and all of those things will create by definition, a level of uncertainty. But we have put a lot of effort into getting our best estimate out there and we use a lot of third-parties to help us to validate the best estimate as well as our view of the variability around that best estimate.
Jay Gelb
Okay. So broadly, how would you characterize the conservatism based into your reserves at this point?
Rob Schimek
I think I have to keep it simple and say that as the SEC rules require we have put forth our best estimate. Our best estimate is informed by all the things that I just described, but I hate to say that we can guarantee any particular result and I hate to say that anything other than the estimate that we put forth is our absolute best estimate.
Jay Gelb
Okay. Let\xe2\x80\x99s turn to another timely and favorable topic. The company recently announced the sale of its mortgage insurance business to Arch Capital for $3.4 billion. I know this is separate from commercial insurance, but it falls within, I believe your area oversight. Can you discuss the decision to sell this business rather than pursue an IPO of the mortgage insurance business?
Rob Schimek
Yes. Let me highlight a couple of very important points here. First of all, you noted the headline price of $3.4 billion. I just also want to emphasize that there is a very important element of reinsurance associated with the transaction. And so for the underwriting years 2014 through 2016, we have assumed \xe2\x80\x93 AIG has assumed from UGC, the reserve risk. I think that we consider that to be a very favorable element also of the transaction that\xe2\x80\x99s not part of the headline purchase price.
Jay Gelb
Favorable from AIG?
Rob Schimek
Favorable from AIG\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, the truth of the matter is obviously the transaction with all of those factors put in place, the headline price as well as the reinsurance agreement that makes sense for both Arch and for AIG. So, you can imagine that this was an interconnected element of the negotiation, but I think many people skip past that reinsurance element way too fast. And so therefore, it is very important to me in commercial, because the insurer of that mortgage guaranty business is the commercial insurance business that I am responsible for.
Jay Gelb
Okay.
Rob Schimek
The second thing I would say is we have \xe2\x80\x93 we always take a very thorough, very holistic view of the options and the opportunities that are out there in the marketplace. So, we considered a partial IPO. We considered a full IPO. We considered multiple sale opportunities. And ultimately, we concluded that the best economic answer for AIG was the sale to Arch, which we announced just last quarter. I will say that, that transaction is slated to close late this year or early next year and so it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult for us to say much more about it, including I know many folks want to know what will we do with the proceeds since maybe this is an accelerated timeframe versus what people might have expected for the sale of UGC.
Jay Gelb
An accelerated?
Rob Schimek
Proceeds.
Jay Gelb
That\xe2\x80\x99s right.
Rob Schimek
Accelerated proceeds in timeframe. So I guess what I would tell you is we will disclose more when we get to the actual closing. In the meantime, you have seen this from us. We are very thoughtful about how we manage capital, but capital means whether we are doing buybacks or whether we are paying dividends or whether we are managing our debt capital, but we are trying to really optimize the way we handle all elements of capital, not simply what\xe2\x80\x99s the quickest way to buyback. We are not marching to a metronome that just really moves at a very specific pace. We are very opportunistic and we are trying to be very thoughtful about the way to optimize the result so that we can get the best return for our stakeholders.
Jay Gelb
That makes a lot of sense. And at the same time, would it be fair to say given that the outset where AIG said it told was to return at least $25 billion of capital to shareholders by the end of 2017 that there might be even some additional confidence around that?
Rob Schimek
Well, I surely would say that I can strongly reiterate our confidence in all of the metrics that we outlined in our strategic plan, so whether it was the commercial accident year loss ratio or our expenses or our buybacks or our return on equity. The truth of the matter is they are all interrelated and this is absolutely gives us confidence. The truth of the matter is we always have had confidence and this just gives us further confidence.
Jay Gelb
Great, okay. Last question before we go to the audience response systems. It\xe2\x80\x99s on the mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. I think it ties nicely into Arch \xe2\x80\x93 with the Arch transaction. There has been clearly a substantial increase in property casualty, merger and acquisition activity over the past several years, most notably, Ace\xe2\x80\x99s $30 billion acquisition of Chubb that closed earlier this year. What\xe2\x80\x99s AIG\xe2\x80\x99s appetite for acquisitions, both large scale and bolt-on?
Rob Schimek
So, I would say that we are very active in looking at anyway to achieve growth whether it\xe2\x80\x99s organic or inorganic growth. And quite frankly, we are also looking at divestitures if there is opportunities for us to optimize our portfolio. I would note by the way that, that we have made a number of smaller bolt-on acquisitions over the past couple of years. We have also made some smaller dispositions, including most recently the sale from the commercial business of NSM, which is a managing general agency that we had acquired just over a year ago. But the idea here is we are seeking to optimize the portfolio. And in general, the way I say it to people is we already have size and scale and depth and breadth of capability. And so I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to get bigger as my primary objective. I want to create more value. I want to be able to do things for our clients that no other insurance company in the world can do. And so if I could find opportunities to add a valuable specialty capability that we currently don\xe2\x80\x99t have or that would be very difficult for us to build out that\xe2\x80\x99s attractive to us. But in general, we are not trying to simply collect companies or simply trying to get to be bigger we are really trying to optimize the overall value equation.
Jay Gelb
Excellent. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go to the audience response systems, since this is the first round of this during this conference, the way this works is I will put up a question on the presentation slides and I believe we have around 10 seconds to key in. Should all have a remote near you and just press the \xe2\x80\x93 what you feel is the best answer. So, the first question is if you currently don\xe2\x80\x99t own shares of AIG or underweight, what would cause you to change your minds? So we can start the countdown. And the results here should come up in just a second. So, around 40% saying they would want to see a higher return on equity. The next largest answer being improved property casualty insurance underwriting results. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk too much about ROE, Rob, but the property casualty underwriting result is probably tied together pretty well. So, on a all-in calendar year results, do you think there is the ability to drive improvement there both on the loss ratio and expense ratio?
Rob Schimek
Yes, absolutely. So, I think all of these things are interconnected, the improved P&C insurance underwriting results, the improved expenses that I described earlier, the $25 billion worth of buybacks that we have announced over the course of the next 2 years. They really all tie nicely into our end objective, which is value creation that would be reflected in a higher return on equity. So, we have given a return on equity target for this year of 8.5% to 8.9% and we do absolutely expect to achieve that. And we hear you loud and clear when what people say that a higher return equity would be a big motivator for buying stock.
Jay Gelb
That ROE, that\xe2\x80\x99s on a normalized basis, right? So, that would also normalize for things like catastrophes, some lower alternative equity \xe2\x80\x93 alternative investment returns in the first half too?
Rob Schimek
That\xe2\x80\x99s right.
Jay Gelb
Okay. Next question, please. My confidence in AIG\xe2\x80\x99s ability to achieve its target, commercial insurance property casualty accident year loss ratio of 60% by the end of 2017 is and keep in mind that the accident year loss ratio was 63.4% in the first half.
Jay Gelb
Okay. And the results here 45% saying higher or very high, so good job Rob, on the \xe2\x80\x93 on convincing folks and also showing that you are well on your way in the first half. It\xe2\x80\x99s clear we have a lot of work to do for those of you who showed us very low and even neutral. So for the record, you have my attention and I am absolutely committed to making sure that we do that in a smart, thoughtful way. Alright. Next question, please, should AIG remain a multi-line insurer or would it create more value for shareholders by separating its life insurance business from its property casualty business. And clearly, I put this [indiscernible] started, the timer, I put this question up sort of more related to the active at stance from a year ago and that clearly that\xe2\x80\x99s had some updates since then, but I feel it\xe2\x80\x99s just helpful to \xe2\x80\x93 for investors to express their view here. Alright. And the response is 31% saying AIG should stay in its current form. 50% saying AIG should separate its life business from P&C and 19% no paying, it must be too early in a day. Any thoughts on this, Rob?
Rob Schimek
Yes. Look I want to use for you an opportunity here just to communicate about reinsuring so \xe2\x80\x93 because I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a great way to illustrate at this point. So we announced in the first quarter a reinsurance transaction with a major European counterparty, so in that case we announced transaction with Swiss Re. As you know, Swiss Re does reinsurance for property casualty as well as for life business. And you might ask yourself, how can AIG entering to a transaction that improves its loss ratio, so therefore it must be good for AIG, but also send it to a very capable, very informed reinsurance partner who is one of the best reinsurance counterparties in the world and have them feel good about it too. And I would tell you that the diversification that Swiss Re achieved through owning property casualty risks that we have sent to them from the United States alongside of for example, international life insurance risks, creates a very interesting element of diversification and a very interesting element of capital efficiency. So don\xe2\x80\x99t underestimate the importance in the value of the capital efficiency and the diversification benefit. I think that many people continue to view the only path forward for exiting the [indiscernible] 50 designations is the separation of life from P&C business, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with that.
Jay Gelb
It\xe2\x80\x99s also fair to say that the life from time and savings businesses historically generate the majority of the free cash flow available for buybacks, dividends and debt service compared to P&C, so if you split those up, that could cause a lot of challenges in terms of return of capital?
Rob Schimek
Yes. I love that point, Jay. I mean I would also say despite the very nature of the business that we write the results of a P&C company will be more volatile than the results of a life and retirement company and so because we are subjected for example to natural catastrophes in the P&C business. So these two businesses together create a very important element of stabilization. I think we can optimize that in a better, smarter way. I think we are working hard to do that, but I do absolutely believe that the life business and the P&C business have a very valuable place together inside of the AIG organization.
Jay Gelb
Okay. Next question, please, should AIG allocate excess capital more to share buybacks and dividends or bolt-on acquisitions, let me start the clock. Okay. Winding down here and almost 80% saying more share buybacks and dividends, only 13% saying bolt-on acquisitions, 8% saying both. So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty consistent with what I would have thought.
Rob Schimek
That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I would say is, it\xe2\x80\x99s very consistent with the strategy that we have been implementing, so $25 billion worth of repurchases and buybacks in the 2016-2017 strategic plan that we have outlined is very consistent with what is showing up here. I would say we will continue to be opportunistic. I think as this market is a soft market in the P&C space, it can present for us interesting bolt-on acquisition opportunities. And you should expect there will be very thoughtfully evaluating whether or not there is opportunities to do something that will create even greater value. But I think generally speaking, that\xe2\x80\x99s very consistent with our strategy.
Jay Gelb
In AIG\xe2\x80\x99s view, how big is a bolt-on dollar amount?
Rob Schimek
Look, I think for us to buy a company that has a purchase price in the hundreds of millions of dollars space is very natural and very easy for us to do. At some point in time, I think we have to just make sure that we are continuing to stay focused on the main objective and not get distracted by too many small bolt-on acquisitions. But I would say low billions or hundreds of millions is probably a range that I would consider would be bolt-on.
Jay Gelb
Okay. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if anyone have any more ARS questions. Alright. Let\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 we have a couple minutes left. We can turn it over to the audience for any questions they may have.
Q - Jay Gelb
First question, right up here front, please.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you, Rob. This is [indiscernible] from Barclays. You mentioned about investments in innovation, technology, Internet of Things like artificial intelligence, big data, big challengers for the future of insurance or should as well as banking and how are you prepared for that change, do you see it as an opportunity or a challenge, threat. And how do you think your new strategy will be facilitated by this change or perhaps, potentially challenged by that change?
Rob Schimek
Yes. We think that innovation is the only option. So I think I would think of this sometimes when I do a presentation, I will show a picture of a dinosaur. I mean it basically just says the innovation or extinction. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a complicated message. Just remember, when you think about the Internet of Things, there are something like 10 billion to 20 billion objects connected by the Internet of Things today. And by the end of this decade, that number will be 50 billion, 60 billion objects. And so you think of the pace of change in the world around us as continuing to increase. And so it\xe2\x80\x99s really important for us to continue to invest in this space. That\xe2\x80\x99s why when Jay asked me about our expense reductions and that would all fall through to the bottom line, I paused there and said, we will continue to make investments in technology, in data, in invitation. And the reason we will is because that\xe2\x80\x99s the path to being our clients\xe2\x80\x99 most valued insurer. That\xe2\x80\x99s the path to creating differentiation for AIG from the rest of the pack. We have a really wonderful advantage at AIG versus many of the rest of our peers and that is the size and scale at which we can do things, so the ability of us to make \xe2\x80\x93 to capture data. So for example, we pay $130 million worth of claims every business day around the United States \xe2\x80\x93 excuse me, around the world, $130 million worth of claims every business day around the world. That is a treasure trove of data. When combined with data that\xe2\x80\x99s available in the outside world, we can have insights that we think are much more valuable than most others in this space. That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing that you will see us investing, but we see this as a huge opportunity and a huge differentiator for AIG.

That\xe2\x80\x99s great. I am afraid we are out of time. But please join me in thanking Rob Schimek from AIG.
