Michael Nannizzi
Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get started here. So everyone takes their seats. Just give a couple of more minutes. We have some seats at the edges here on the corners.
All right, chill I\xe2\x80\x99m Mike Nannizzi, I\xe2\x80\x99m the property & casualty insurance here at Goldman Sachs. We\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to have AIG joining us here today. AIG has approximately $66 billion from market capitalization among the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest property and casualty insurers, with a large life insurance operation as well.
Joining us today from AIG is Sid Sankaran. Sid is AIGs Executive Vice President and CFO. Prior to being appointed CFO in 2015, Sid served as the Company\xe2\x80\x99s Chief Risk Officer and was responsible for overseeing the Company\xe2\x80\x99s approach to both pricing and macro economic risk factors.
Today, as CFO one of his primary responsibilities is overseeing the company\xe2\x80\x99s strategic plan including its $25 billion capital return through 2017, a core product of this strategy laid out in the beginning of the year and one that has been a central focus of investors.
And with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Sid for his opening comments and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down for some Q&A. Thanks.
Siddhartha Sankaran
Thank you, Mike. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just point you to our forward looking cautionary statements to read [indiscernible]. But really today, what I wanted to cover were progress on our financial targets, specifically our return-on-equity in both our operating and legacy portfolio.
Our general operating expense or efficiency program, capital management, book value per share growth and our accident year loss ratio. Before I dive into the detail, I thought it would be helpful for this side end if we just step back a little bit and provided some broader context for strategic planning.
So I always like to point people back to Peter Hancock\xe2\x80\x99s initial shareholder letter when he became CEO in early 2015. In that letter, I think Peter really highlighted three things. You know the first, was a priority to simplify the organization and focus on our core operating margins. Secondly, a need to invest particularly in data, science and technology. And thirdly, a commitment to scope the company and create a meaner more focused AIG.
As we provided an update on our strategic plan really in January of this year, I think the market context of that time is also of note. First, really, we saw a challenging interest rate outlook ahead of us and more importantly, we saw a lot of excess capital in the commercial insurance space. So our plan really focussed on aligning three things; revenues where we were targeting shrinking, expenses where we were accelerating our expense reduction plan and finally capital where we were committed to returning excess capital to shareholders.
So when you think of our strategy you need to think of those three elements, revenue, expenses and capital as really aligned. And as we sit here today, really three quarters into what I see as an eight quarter plan, I think we are very pleased with the progress against our strategic objectives and also against our goals and remain confident in hitting our 2017 targets.
I\xe2\x80\x99m going to turn the page -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said before we really feel AIG is best valued and best in three parts. First, in blue the operating portfolio, this is about three quarters of the company\xe2\x80\x99s capital and is our core business. If you were targeting at 10% return on equity and growth in strategic segments.
Secondly, in green the legacy portfolio, this is about a quarter of the company\xe2\x80\x99s capital. Here our objective is different; here we are focused on return of capital and free cash flow while minimizing the impact of book value per share.
Finally, in yellow what is really important to us is our deferred tax asset. And for those of you who haven\xe2\x80\x99t followed AIG that closely that the deferred tax asset for us is a very valuable source of free cash flow. And so, while there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of dialogue around changes in tax policy and it\xe2\x80\x99s still very preliminary at our investor day we did highlight some preliminary analysis. I think the key message is that we feel a reduction in the statutory tax rate is a positive for intrinsic value and a walk through why. First, for us we still believe that we\xe2\x80\x99re utilizing full all our foreign tax credits. So those will shield the higher amount of taxable income, which is very important.
Secondly, as you reduce the statutory tax rate, if there were an immediate reduction to 25% that would be approximately a 90 basis point increase in our return on equity. If it were to be an immediate reduction to 20%, that would be an increase in our normalized return on equity about 150 basis points. So we feel given where we are in the tax basis that that would close our gap on an ROE sense to peers.
Finally, clearly if we were to reduce the overall statutory tax rate as a function of tax policy, we did highlight that that would result in a re-measurement of our DTA, so an immediate reduction to 25% would result in a $4 billion re-measurement of our deferred tax asset associated with our NOLs and our timing differences and a reduction to 20% would be about $6 billion with respect to a re-measurement of those NOLs and the timing difference DTA.
So, that is in punch line a summary of how we think about valuing the company. If I turn the page and focus on the operating portfolio, here I leave you with a couple of messages. We have been extremely focussed on improving the overall return on equity of the operating portfolio and feel we\xe2\x80\x99ve improved it by about 150 basis points year-on-year. This has largely been a function of three things, improving our risk margins, our operating efficiency and capital management.
As we look to 2017, our projection is for approximately a 10% return on the operating portfolio and this will be a function of two drivers, continued efficiency gains which we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about as well as continued underwriting improvements particularly on the loss ratio side.
For a moment spending a little bit of time on general operating expenses or what we call think of as our efficiency program. We expect as we announced on investor day to exceed our two-year target on expenses and efficiency.
As we said and disclosed in our last earnings call, we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken out about $800 million of operating expense, general operating expense as normalized on an operating basis year-to-date, so that is roughly 57% of the target we announced. Based on actions we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken already with respect to compensation and benefits, and in particular professional fees, we are anticipating approximately an additional 36% reduction of $500 million in the forward looking run rate.
So we feel we are about 93% of the way there, and this is really been based on our principles of simplification, modularity and automation and at the same time we\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking our expenses, we have done that while continuing to invest in strategic programs particularly technology. So again, the main message here is we expect to exceed our two-year targets on this dimension.
Capital return, obviously, as Mike alluded to this is a favourite topic of our investors and our analysts. And so, we feel we are very confident in meeting our capital return targets of atleast $25 billion of return of capital to shareholders. This slide has a few items that I call your attention to.
First, as of the investor day of a couple of weeks ago, we completed about $11.6 billion of capital return. We have remaining authorisation as of that date of approximately $3.6 billion. That leaves $9.8 billion remaining to our capital return target.
As we highlighted in the green bar here, we see about $12 billion to $17 billion of funding sources available to meet that $9.8 billion. What are those sources? First, we have $5 billion to $7 billion of dividends and tax sharing payments that would be net of our overhead and interest expense. Secondly, we spent a fair bit of time at investor day walking through the divestitures that we\xe2\x80\x99ve announced to scope the portfolio. There we see $4 billion to $5 billion roughly of free cash flow in our projections.
Thirdly, we previously announced a set of Life Reinsurance transaction having executed one of those transactions in the third quarter. So we have about $3 billion to $4 billion of funding from the Life Reinsurance transactions and as we announced previously we\xe2\x80\x99ve our new Doug Dachille, has announced a set of asset management and portfolio changes and in particular focussing on hedge funds and third party managers and we\xe2\x80\x99re still about roughly upto $1 billion of additional dividend flows coming from that reallocation.
So again, the rare punch line here is we remain comfortable with our targets and confident that we are going to hit them given our track record. What I would say I\xe2\x80\x99m most proud of is that we continue to do that without sacrificing the strength of our balance sheet. So as you see on this slide, we continue to maintain very healthy capital ratios in our subsidiaries and in addition I think we have industry leading free cash flow and holding company liquidity that really indicates for us a very strong strength of balance sheet.
Legacy, so I alluded to the legacy portfolio in our initial comments and our investor day did highlight a set of additional disclosures and I think Charlie Shamieh and the Focus Legacy team we have are doing a terrific job. A couple of few points here, first the legacy through nine months year-to-date has continued to act as a drag on our overall ROE, it\xe2\x80\x99s about minus 2%. We think as we are looking forward on a normalized basis the ROE will be in a range of 3% to 5%.
Again, the objectives here for legacy has been return of capital and free cash flow. And as you can see from the chart, we think roughly through three quarters of the year we\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to take legacy down from that roughly 25% to 16% and our liquidity to parent here the free cash flow has been about $6.3 billion from the fourth quarter to now. So Charlie and the team are focused, they are executing and you should expect to continue to see us update you with new transactions each quarter.
So this is the perfect time I think for me to shift a little bit to talk about our business. And with respect to both commercial and consumer, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage each of you who didn\xe2\x80\x99t get chance to listen in on our investor day to pay attention to the remarks from Rob Schimek, our head of commercial and Kevin Hogan, our head of consumer and I think they frankly did a fabulous job in explaining why AIG has such great market leadership and unique franchisees. They gave detail I think on why we have market leadership with our clients, why we have market leadership with our distribution partners and how we are continuing to innovate and so it was a great opportunity to hear from them in a little more detail than you might have heard on a normal earnings call.
With respect to our commercial portfolio which is the area where obviously we spend the most time in our discussion. We provided detail which really highlights and this chart is an important one because it highlights based on the internal amount of capital we\xe2\x80\x99ve allocated at our mix of business and where we\xe2\x80\x99re heading. And where we\xe2\x80\x99re heading is in line with our goal of maximising intrinsic value, of course meeting client objectives, but also driving ROE improvement.
If you see on this slide, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard for me to see in small fund that we have a lot of levers that we can move. And so this slide is important because first you see the growth levers primary casualty international, M&A, cyber in the property space in particular large limit where we have a very unique capability as well as energy and engineered risk or I would say the same as well as credit lines.
At the same time, we are reducing participation in many segments of the overall portfolio, most clearly in excess casualty in the U.S. but also you see that in different pockets of environmental, E&S and property where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been actively reducing the portfolio and pricing has been challenged as well as programs and pockets of the aerospace business.
We are also going to continue to be very opportunistic, and so you saw a little bit of that where we are managing with intrinsic value and ROE enhancement as a top priority where we announced in the third quarter the sale of both MSM and Ascot and we are going to be opportunistic, you can also expect an allocating capital based on market conditions.
And we think that capital allocation along with a lot of what we are doing and I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to you in a second on the account level side are really going to drive that ROE improvement that we talked about.
Accident year combined ratio as adjusted. The trend since year-end 2015 through the nine months of the year we think has been very strong with three points of improvements in the accident year combined ratio as adjusted. Now we\xe2\x80\x99ve announced a target of about six points over two years from 2015 to 2017 on an exit [ph] run rate basis around the accident year loss ratio as adjusted. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got two points of that which I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to you in a little bit more detail.
Equally important and what we are doing based on the shift and mix of business is actively managing the expense ratio where you see a point of improvement as well as managing the mix of Cadex [ph] of those business. So we shared in our investor day our AAL.
And clearly here as I alluded to before, integrating revenue expense and managing capital for this portfolio of business is key because you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get the cost and the fixed expense out while you are remixing that portfolio and bringing it down you know to improve the underwriting margin.
With a quick shift, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to talk now about what\xe2\x80\x99s driving the loss ratio improvement. So if you look at this slide, obviously our starting point is a 66% roughly accident year loss ratio as adjusted for full year 2015. We think year-to-date we got about two points of that, that\xe2\x80\x99s been driven largely by big business mix as well as improvements in casualty.
Now just a reminder on the casualty side, we think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got solid rate improvement now for the past four quarters. That has been \xe2\x80\x93 that improvement has been offset a little by the programs adjustment in the last peak that we talked about in the third quarter, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the two points that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten so far year-to-date.
The biggest driver of the forward-looking improvement as Rob has talked about has been the difference between written and earned. So based on the actions we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken with the book and what we\xe2\x80\x99ve underwritten over the next year or five quarters we expect that to earn into the P&L. And that will be about two points of improvement.
We did call out and we have done some questions around the UGC quota share and so, one comment that I might make that hopefully could be helpful in clarifying the UGC quota share for you is when we announced our targets in January of this year around six points, we did not include any of the subsequent divestitures that we announced.
So we did not include in that projection the sale of Ascot, MSM and Fairfax each of those you can think of as negative to us with respect to our loss ratio improvement plans plus positive to us when you are thinking about combined ratio, ROE and intrinsic value. And that loss ratio impact was offset by the positive from UGC.
So it\xe2\x80\x99s net flat and we did that just to be pretty transparent to folks so they could understand where the loss ratio improvements are coming from. You know in addition to those steps what we see as the coming benefits from exits, which are exits that we have announced that are coming up for renewal which will earn their way in. Growth, I talked about key growth lines just a second ago and then finally risk selection, because ultimately the big driver for us here is around ensuring rate adequacy on our book. And so, there we have a real discipline around what we called AQI or Account Quality Index that\xe2\x80\x99s driving the risk selection.
So the sum of that is what\xe2\x80\x99s driving our loss ratio improvement and as we sit here today we remain confident in that target and are looking forward to updating you a little bit more when we get to your end.
Flipping very quickly to consumer, you know again here we pictured how we are allocating our capital, so again this is a picture to scale on capital. But each of our businesses the key message I leave you with or at scale you know individual retirement is really variable annuity, index annuity and fixed annuity and in this space we\xe2\x80\x99re not number one in any of those segments but we are top five in each of them and number one in aggregate and here what really drives you know sustainable returns above our cost of capital is being agile on how we deploy that capital. When we look at the market and opportunities between those products, we do not have fixed distribution that we need to feed and so risk management is a key here in our competitive differentiation.
When you look at group retirement, you know Vallack [ph] has a very strong franchise and again if you look at assets under management, I believe Kevin highlighted this at Investor Day we are number two in the [indiscernible] sector, I believe we are number three in higher education, number four in healthcare. So very strong franchise here and solid profitability.
Life, you know obviously this is smaller segment of our capital allocated and with some of the reinsurance transactions; we\xe2\x80\x99ve been focussed on ROE enhancement and managing risk and capital here. This is largely U.S. Life book and for the first time we are back in the top five in the U.S. with respect to term sales which is where we want to be given the investment, interest rate environment at this point in time.
Finally, personal insurance. So personal insurance again we spent a lot more time talking about of late, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve had strong margin expansion here and in particular we have segments of the market that we think we have a prominent franchise and are growing.
With respect to consumer insurance and base yields and spreads, this is going to be key driver of earnings and we\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to maintain our discipline here on both pricing and asset liability management. So we\xe2\x80\x99ve previously disclosed that we think net spreads are going to decline about two to four basis points a quarter that obviously was in the second quarter when interest rates were lower. We are going to continue to evaluate our forecast and update that but obviously the interest rate environment has turned a little bit more positively of late.
And my final slide is on personal insurance which is you can see here, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got very margin expansion in personal insurance. We have sustainable loss ratio since time. We have been improving that expense ratio and feel pleased with where it is, but it still has more to come.
It has really got some elements of this business that are tremendous franchise, our private client group has been growing and benefitting from industry consolidation. We recently announced a very innovative multinational ultra high network, home owners property, which we think is unique in the market.
And so this business with its cash flow, it\xe2\x80\x99s risk, its diversification characteristics is a great contributor to the portfolio and we are pleased with how it\xe2\x80\x99s been improving but we still have a little bit more to do and we are confident in the team that\xe2\x80\x99s working on it.
So with that, Mike I tried to blow through a lot of information for you. We\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it open for some Q&A. But maybe well -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll grab a seat.
Q - Michael Nannizzi
Great. Thanks so much. Starting on with a couple of questions from the audience, feel free to raise your hand or get the mike over to you. So I guess that one thing you mentioned at your investor day you talked and you alluded to in your presentation here as why that you are running ahead of your deployment targets or atleast the capital generation targets that you had outlined at the beginning of this year, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t update the deployment part.
I guess one of the question is, how should we be thinking about that addition or you talked about that sort of $12 billion to $17 billion versus the $9.8 billion to complete the $25 billion, is there a scenario where you would expect that capital to remain in the company or is it just a matter of timing in terms of how you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about that?
Siddhartha Sankaran
Yes. We\xe2\x80\x99ve broken out the sources for you, right. We\xe2\x80\x99ve given you the dividends and tax sharing contribution, contribution of divestitures, as well as the life insurance transaction and hedge funds, so we have a good sense what\xe2\x80\x99s driving our funding sources for the remaining $9.8 billion. I think what I would say is, we remain confident in that $25 billion and returning at least $25 billion of capital as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said.
And clearly each of those funding sources that are going to come in over time, but I think to me the punch line when you look at this company extending in 2017 and beyond it has an extremely strong balance sheet, great free cash flow, tremendous capital generation. And so, we\xe2\x80\x99re constantly going to evaluate our alternatives for capital deployment between organic growth, capital return for share in organic growth and we\xe2\x80\x99re always evaluating that. But we just came out and I think at the Investor Day you guys all heard we\xe2\x80\x99re reiterating that at least $25 billion target.
Michael Nannizzi
Great. Thanks for that. And then, you talk a bit about margins on the commercial cycle, that\xe2\x80\x99s another area that\xe2\x80\x99s been a focus I think in the third quarter, the year-over-year improvement slowed. You\xe2\x80\x99ve reiterated your view on margin improvement for 2017 and 2018. Can you sort of help to reconcile third quarter versus the continued confidence and your view that you can generate the margin expansion that you expected at the beginning of the year?
Siddhartha Sankaran
Yes. I think, first of all nothing ever works perfectly in a straight line, as I always say, so I think you had very solid performance in the first quarter, in the second quarter and the third quarter had a couple of items to know. You know most important is programs. And so in programs we did catch up the loss pick in the third quarter and so you need to keep in mind that previously disclosed adjustments of loss pick for programs was rolled into the third quarter.
Michael Nannizzi
Okay. I understand.
Siddhartha Sankaran
But you know, I think most importantly, obviously is looking forward and as we look forward we have a clear line aside. I think Rob and the team have done a terrific job in remixing the portfolio of business. And so, when you look at the bar that we shared with you on what is yet to earn into the P&L that is a function of actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken, so its not dependent on the pricing markets, its changes in the mix of business and there was a chart Rob had that particularly showed in Product Set 2b and 3 which is the poor performing portions of the portfolio, that segment coming down by about two points, I think $6 million, but its roughly I think a third, I remember in that slide from the Investor Day which I -- people to, so that obviously the key driver of the forward looking P&L.
Michael Nannizzi
Got it. And I guess, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking ahead, now we sort of talked about these different factors in addition to the non-renewal business clearly the reinsurance program that you undertook early this year that\xe2\x80\x99s had an impact on the top line. How are you looking at when that contract comes up for renewal, what happens to the premiums that you see it, you probably have some view on how that focus performing. How should we thinking about that coming to fruition. Is it we\xe2\x80\x99re going to re-up that reinsurance program or maybe some business comes back to AIG or is there another option out there that you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about it?
Siddhartha Sankaran
Well, I think the most important thing I think about that and insurance transaction to notice that obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re re-underwriting that entire portfolio. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a quota share of transaction, so the whole portfolio it has not been disruptive to our clients since reinsured, you know when we think of some of the larger transactions which is what I think you\xe2\x80\x99re alluding to. On those quota share of transactions there are obviously reinsured back to third-party provider, third-party re-insurer and we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to re-underwrite that book, so that book is being subject to the same standards on a camp quality index, rate increases that the rest of portfolio is.
So while we actively remediate it, when we get to a point where we have to make that decision we do think there are plenty of alternatives open to us, obviously potentially you alluded to re-up in that transaction, restructuring the nature of that transaction with one or more insurers, retaining that business back on our books if we see its meeting our cost to capital. So, something we\xe2\x80\x99re I think the team has been very thoughtful about how they approach it and we\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable with how that overall for the forward looking business..
Michael Nannizzi
Okay. And then today obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re stepping outstand of insurances, a lot has happened in the last several weeks views on regulation, taxation which you alluded in your presentation, interest rates. Talk to me about how you are thinking about those changes and how they impact the maintenance of your strategic plan that you outlined at the beginning of this year and if the interest rates were a lot higher six months or a year from now there are things that you might consider doing differently?
Siddhartha Sankaran
Yes. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a broad question, Mike; I\xe2\x80\x99ll try and break into\xe2\x80\xa6
Michael Nannizzi
I could make it broader if you want to.
Siddhartha Sankaran
I\xe2\x80\x99ll try and break it into pieces. I think we can put tax aside, because I think in my prepared remarks covered that, so maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll focus on interest rates and regulation. We always plan for multiple scenarios and multiple potential outcome, so with respect to rates in the second quarter we highlighted some disclosure and how we think the impact on interest rate obviously is with respect to both new business and with respect to the in-force. So you can break it a little bit between commercial and consumer and then we can speak about 2018 and beyond.
When you look at the in-force business for the consumer business, we announce that we had certain long-tail liabilities that were impacted by falling rates, obviously rising rates are positive for us with respect to that in-force book. So, in the second quarter we said that we thought our estimate of intrinsic value getting changes and interest rates of the market is down about 5% from the beginning of the year. Obviously the change in rates has rallied up, right. That\xe2\x80\x99s positive. When we look at the commercial in-force, obviously the sensitivity and interest rates will relatively well match.
It\xe2\x80\x99s less the question of interest rates and more a question of the underlying drivers of reserve and their financial inflation is probably less than the driver than medical cost inflation or poor temperature as we\xe2\x80\x99ve disclosed. But obviously inflation is something that we watch carefully in line with rates.
On the new business side, clearly for commercial high rates potentially means both higher volumes and high margins in terms of value of new business. And with respect to the commercial business where our long-tail lines are most impacted, higher rates as long as lost cost trends are eclipse by pricing, right and we always have to be careful what people think our rates in growth versus inflation, so again inflation is important as cost inflation.
Again we probably see that as a positive both with respect to volume and potentially with respect to a current value of new business. So, broadly the trend on the rate side we view as a positive. We carefully manage and watch inflation. And still I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of uncertainty geopolitically. So we really have a bank one rate scenario. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get too down on the prior rate environment but people thought it was place two months ago and I\xe2\x80\x99m not overly getting third party over higher, so I think you had to mange it carefully. So that\xe2\x80\x99s how we think about it. We\xe2\x80\x99re very discipline on the ALM side.
Michael Nannizzi
But I guess in looking like life insurance, stocks and reactions to higher interest rates, as you think about the different business whether its P&C life or newly different businesses within those larger segments, does the change in the environment change the way that you\xe2\x80\x99ve thought about either retaining or disposing or divesting of assets?
Siddhartha Sankaran
No, very simply. I think we \xe2\x80\x93 and I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain why? We obviously actively look at the portfolio and evaluating the pieces on an intrinsic value basis, on some of the part basis, but for us our key driver with respect to the life business, the retirement business that you live to are two things; one the foreign tax credits, so these are interlink to some of the issues you\xe2\x80\x99ve highlighted.
On the foreign tax credit side, we continue to utilize how plans in place to utilize that foreign tax credit, that\xe2\x80\x99s a very valuable foreign tax credit. That\xe2\x80\x99s approximately about $5 billion, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the function of keeping the life and property casualty, entities together. And secondly, you continue to see capital diversification benefits. And while I think there may have been scepticism around the capital diversification benefits when we mentioned them about a year ago around this time. I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen with how external parties rating agencies look at break up and other scenarios they are real capital implications for main [ph] curves and spin curves and all the likes, so we are focused on those two elements and those two contributors to our intrinsic values to holders.
Michael Nannizzi
Great. Thanks for that. Any questions from the audience. I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep on going here. Again, if you have one, please feel free to raise your hand. When you think about clearly lots of expense cuts, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been very focused on taking the expense ratio down and which is come down and remain flat despite the reduction in premium levels. So you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about that, how much is that impact did you\xe2\x80\x99re franchise, your abilities to customers or your constituents or broker intermediaries or work with reinsurance companies in terms of just from and infrastructure perspective. Is that put more stress on the remainder or is that some thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to kind of just really trim access the capacity?
Siddhartha Sankaran
Yes. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a great question Mike. I think you\xe2\x80\x99re first and in our business one of the biggest implications I think any kind of expenses transformation is people, right, people are big contributor to our costs and particularly on the business side, it\xe2\x80\x99s a continuity issue. And so, you know brokers or clients dealt with somebody on our end to that, somebody new facing off against them. What I will tell you just two things, one I think there was probably more noise at the beginning of the year, but I think Rob Schimek and his team got couple of folks in our commercial business sitting out there in the audience have done an absolutely terrific job on working with brokers and clients.
At an attending some of the recent client council, some of the feedback we get is actually the changes, while we had great people and they contributed to our success historically is while there is always noise in the initial change, some of the new people we\xe2\x80\x99re getting feedback from the clients, coming back to us and saying, hey, a new person is better than the person I had before, this person is terrific. And so I think it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously got some disruptive elements because of the human component but I think Rob and the team has done a very, very nice job.
Michael Nannizzi
Great.
Siddhartha Sankaran
We have a question.
Michael Nannizzi
We have a question.

You had paint the go forward picture of the commercial insurance business is kind of the big drivers of the improved combined being better risk selection. How much of that is actually you think better underwriting practices or just kind of a hardening of rates overall and you think that the market is going to get little better?
Siddhartha Sankaran
Well, I mean, I can tell you in our projections we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of hardening of rates and if you look at our strategy, our strategy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been growth strategy right, it has been shrunk it deliberately both strong two levels. First, I would say a portfolio level, so you saw the capital allocation slide what parts of the business were actually growing and shrinking. The second is around what we call Camp [ph] Quality Index.
So we rate each of our camps has you might expect A, B, C and D as if they were grades in school. And each of them had a different hurdle to hit rate adequacy when we look at our overall return targets in meeting our cost of equities. And so the primary driver at this point is we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously had some dramatic shift in business mix as I alluded to.
We think in particularly AQI, which has been a big contributor, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be contributor in the window. So I would say the driver for us is more in the business mix shift and AQI its not really more optimistic view on rates.
Unidentified Analyst
Great. I guess, you touch a little bit on the consumer business and so what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening there. I think at Investor Day Kevin had mentioned that we\xe2\x80\x99re trimming some geographies that one that performing because a lack of scale whereas you continue to have good performance in those scale markets. And then you also sort of touch a little bit on Japan. Just trying to get an idea, once you sort of get rid of some of those sub-scale markets, how much of a tailwind should we expect that to be to your performance and consumer and then post the integration in Japan, just maybe an update on timing there and how should we be thinking about that from just a order of magnitude perspective on profitability?
Siddhartha Sankaran
Yes. I think the most important metric that I think, I will call your attention to on personal insurance business is what we refer to as medium term target at 92% to 94% and the reason that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a firm date on it, just we\xe2\x80\x99ve alluded to Mike is and the dependency on our work on integration in Japan. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t provide any update on timing but I think as Kevin has said once we go through the merger approval process and as we have something that we could disclose we will obviously disclose that and that can give you more certainty on the timing side.
I think that, again when you look at this business you see very sustainable loss ratios, and so, much of the challenge that we have are around implementing the strategies on efficiency as well as on growth. And on the underlies as we\xe2\x80\x99ve highlighted with U.S. PCG you see double-digit growth there and we\xe2\x80\x99re very pleased about that. And as you look at the work that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done on exiting or running off specific companies as we sit here in December we feel good about that as well. So, I think when you look at that business I think setting that medium term combined ratio target out there and looking at the business mix and the premium you can see that this could be a strong contributor with respect to earnings in franchise.
Unidentified Analyst
Got it. And have you quantify though that just timing aside that sort of how much you\xe2\x80\x99re spending, excess spending is coming into the sort of integration effort in Japan and what that might look like once whenever that is done when its done?
Siddhartha Sankaran
Yes. I think the previous number that I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve disclosed is roughly over 125 to 159, one-time costs \xe2\x80\x93 run rate.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay.
Siddhartha Sankaran
Obviously, there are other offsets against that is we have also announced that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking out certain costs associated at the same time with the integration of what we\xe2\x80\x99re permitted to do from a regulatory standpoint and we are absolutely 110% focused on meeting the regulatory requirements and the needs of the regulators that are in Japan. So obviously when we look at that investment, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at on economic basis and we\xe2\x80\x99re saying given the alternatives out there that we are exposed to do we think that these -- the one-time costs is accretive. And the answer is we do and we think it has income payback period particularly first merger very quick.

You mentioned in your presentation punch of targets that management said between capital return, expenses, ROE and then the commercial P&C loss ratio, realize that are important but is there any way you could rank order them as far as importance to management or I guess focus \xe2\x80\x93 key focus areas?
Siddhartha Sankaran
Yes. You know Peter highlighted pyramid that really in the Investor Day there was a slide, which had a pyramid which really at the top was intrinsic value. An intrinsic value is not disclosed, but we think of it very much in the context of the value, you will say the value of the in-force kind of the embedded value of the balance sheet and what drives franchise value, future value of new business kind of profits and margins with respect to our clients, that is really at the top of our pyramid.
Beneath that we had ROE and book value per share growth and we think ROE obviously gives you a good sense on return on capital and our ability to meet our cost of capital and obviously in the long term sustainable book value per share growth is obviously a very strong indicator of intrinsic value growth. Beneath that there are lot of different subsidiary variables and we always have to be make trade-offs between them whether its loss ratio, expense ratio and growth, all those input. So, we really created that pyramid to try and give people a sense of the higher metrics that we\xe2\x80\x99re managing to.
It\xe2\x80\x99s not perfect, but when you look at some of the actions we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken, I look at Ascot as a great one. That\xe2\x80\x99s one where obviously Ascot is - the new owner of Ascot is very vantage owner of Ascot and we looked at that from a sense of maybe damaging to the loss ratio, but we think about our intrinsic value, ROE, book value per share in the long term sustainable way we thought there is a value accretive transaction.

First the $25 billion total cap return, if you lose the [Indiscernible] designation, where does that 25 go to?
Siddhartha Sankaran
25, I mean, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty consistent that we first of all, again start with what we think the right thing to do is and look at overall balance sheet strength and what we need to look like to maintain the trust of our clients and regulators and so we said that one of our primary constraints has been the rating agencies that\xe2\x80\x99s where we focus and so we continue to target atleast $25 million of capital return.
Michael Nannizzi
One more here in the corner.
Unidentified Analyst
Can you hear me?
Siddhartha Sankaran
Yes.
Unidentified Analyst
Is there a way, you meant -- the DTA and what happened to that, the domestic part of it in the case of corporate tax reduction. Is there a way to accelerate the usage of that whether it be through M&A or something strategic if you felt like the tax rate was coming down for sure?
Siddhartha Sankaran
Yes, what I would say is you know as part of our normal business planning and risk management we evaluate a range of \xe2\x80\x93 evaluate a test or range of strategies to ensure that that valuable DTA gets utilized. So we \xe2\x80\x93 I would just say we consider and tax alternatives, it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that you can think of it being on auto pilot.
Unidentified Analyst
Is there some reason why you would not be able to accelerate some of the usage if you thought, like if someone told you 100% for sure tax rate is coming down, 2018 you have one year to do something to use it, before you have to impair some, is there reason why you cannot do that atleast to some extent in the U.S.?
Siddhartha Sankaran
Yes, well just a reminder going back to our presentation earlier in the year, yes our foreign tax credit there is a cap on foreign source income and so there is a maximum amount that you can utilize on giving yield. We do feel we have the right risk management and capital and business planning strategies as we said to utilize about $2 billion to $2.5 billion over the next two years, but you do have that better to limitation on your ability on the foreign tax credit. You know with respect to the NOLs that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a function of income, taxable income.
And so again, we evaluate everything as we you know again we go through on business planning strategies.
Michael Nannizzi
Okay. I think we are about done. Thank you so much Sid.
Siddhartha Sankaran
Thank you.
Michael Nannizzi
Thanks for your time. Thanks everybody for the meeting here.
Siddhartha Sankaran
