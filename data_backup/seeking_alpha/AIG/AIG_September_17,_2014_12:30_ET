Liz
Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. I am Liz Werner and for anyone I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to meet yet, I am the Head of Investor Relations at AIG. And today, you have the opportunity to learn more about our global consumer strategy and our valuable presence in Japan. So, we have two sessions for Q&A today. And while we may not answer all your questions, we recognize that future financial presentations will allow for additional follow-up, your patience as we consider ongoing potential financial disclosures is appreciated.
So, I must remind you that today\xe2\x80\x99s presentation may contain certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\xe2\x80\x99s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes and circumstances. Any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events, actual performance and events may differ possibly materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause this include those described in our first and second quarter Form 10-Qs and our 2013 10-K. AIG is not under any obligation, expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Today\xe2\x80\x99s presentation may also contain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures are included in this presentation and may also be found in our financial supplement that is on our website at www.aig.com. In addition and similar to other U.S. companies, our Japanese statutory filings do not reconcile the U.S. GAAP financials.
At this time, I would like to introduce Jose Hernandez. Some of you had the opportunity to meet Jose. He is the CEO of our Asia-Pacific region. He has been with AIG for 20 years, including experience as Global Head of Accident & Health and 10 years of experience in Japan. He is currently based in Tokyo and he will begin our welcoming remarks today.
Jose Hernandez - President and Chief Executive Officer, Asia-Pacific
Thanks, Liz. (Foreign Language)
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AIG\xe2\x80\x99s Investor Day. I am Jose Hernandez and I am the President and CEO of the Asia-Pacific region and today I will serve as your moderator. This is the first time that AIG has participated in this event. And before we start, we want to take the opportunity to thank all of you for your participation. The Asia-Pacific region is a strong contributor to the overall results of AIG. In 2013, net premiums written of $9.7 billion, represented 28% of the AIG PC overall contributions to AIG. The region is comprised of 14 countries, of which Japan is by far the largest, especially considering that Japan has the second largest operations for AIG outside of the United States. AIG is uniquely positioned in the region, particularly here in Japan to better balance growth, profit and risk as we strive to become the most valuable insurer in the eyes of our customers and shareholders.
To facilitate the interactions today, we thought best to breakdown the presentations into two sections. First, we will present our global consumer businesses. And after a very short break, we will introduce the Japan team to present our overall operations in Japan and strategies. That will be followed by a Q&A session. I am sorry, because I skipped over this. After the global consumer business presentation, we\xe2\x80\x99ll also have a Q&A session that focus on that part. The presentations today will be done in English, but as we start the Q&A session, we will have translators. We have translators here in the room. So, for those of you who prepared to ask and have your questions answered in Japanese, we can certainly do that.
So, let\xe2\x80\x99s get started. Our first presenter was appointed Chief Executive Officer, AIG Global Consumer Insurance in October 2013. Mr. Hogan, who previously had 24 years, a 24-year career with AIG was most recently Chief Executive Officer of Global Life at the Zurich Insurance Group. It\xe2\x80\x99s a privilege to have Kevin in Japan to firsthand present AIG\xe2\x80\x99s global consumer business. Please welcome, Kevin Hogan.
Kevin Hogan - Chief Executive Officer, Global Consumer Insurance
Well, thank you, Jose and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen here in Tokyo and also good afternoon, good morning, good evening to those on the webcast. As Jose said, the first part of our sessions today is an introduction to the Global Consumer Insurance business, a business that was formed late last year by AIG. And Global Consumer Insurance brings together AIG\xe2\x80\x99s life, health, and disability businesses alongside our Property Casualty Consumer businesses of personal accident, supplemental health, automobile, insurance, extended warranty and our travel services business.
Global Consumer in Japan are very closely linked, because Japan is one of the largest, it\xe2\x80\x99s the second largest of the Global Consumer businesses. And here in Japan by far the majority of the business is in fact the Global Consumer portfolio. So, I hope that this introduction that I will provide in the next roughly 30 minutes, 35 minutes of presentation followed by a brief Q&A, will act as context or the deep dive that we will provide you on our Japanese businesses in subsequent presentations.
Global Consumer builds off of the One AIG philosophy. As we leverage the learnings of both our brothers and sisters in the property casualty commercial business, as well as the experiences of the life and retirement services businesses from the last few years. The Global Consumer business, as you will see, is large and diverse. And so in order to stay focused, I would ask you to pay attention to three important messages from the information I am going to provide.
And the first is that we believe we have a unique franchise that will be difficult to duplicate in today\xe2\x80\x99s world. We are driven by a data-oriented strategy, data-oriented decision-making, including our data-driven pricing, which will provide more information about today. And the third is that we have a focused growth strategy. It\xe2\x80\x99s a big world out there. There is a universe of opportunities and it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we have a layer of prioritizing our investments.
So, I will address each of these three topics in succession and provide some examples. But first, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to just take a step back and provide a little bit of context around One AIG. So prior our first quarter and second quarter releases, we had two solid quarters, as we focus in 2014 on our core operations balancing between growth, profitability and risk. And we are driven by economic value seeking economic returns in excess of our cost of capital as we drive towards our mission of being the world\xe2\x80\x99s most valued insurer as defined by our various stakeholders, by our customers, our shareholders, our distributor partners and our people. And we intend on being the most valued insurer by using our risk expertise to help our customers understand and reduce ultimately their cost of risks. And using the global capabilities of AIG to provide value-added products and services that leverage our unique global position, our unique access to data and our unique capabilities to deliver the insights needed to serve our customers. In 2014, our priorities have been an intense focus on our customers, strong growth and profitability in our operating businesses, enhancing our operational efficiency and continuing to invest in our people.
The Global Consumer business brings together all of AIG\xe2\x80\x99s insurance products and services for consumers, whether individual or group-based contracts. And the strategy is built on three foundation pillars, each of which I will provide more detail about today. First, we have a unique franchise, not only in terms of the territories in which we operate, not only in terms of the products, where we are bringing together the life, health and disability along with the former PC consumer products, but also in the long operating experience that we have and the expertise we have developed over time and most importantly, the relationships that we have built, many relationships going back decades.
Second, we have used a data-driven strategy, including data-driven pricing. This is an area AIG has invested and will continue to invest in significantly. We emphasized the use of data in all of our decisions, whether in terms of product development, in marketing, in pricing, in customer selection, in behavior analysis and overall optimization of our portfolios. And we are beginning to see results, which I will share today. And third, we target focused growth. The universe for our business is huge. And so we have to be disciplined in our strategy deployments and we are balancing the number between growth, profitability and risk. And so this is one of our cornerstones as which we built our business to maximize the risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.
To put the opportunity in context, in the markets in which we already have either a property casualty or a life insurance license, predominantly property casualty licenses, the total universe between the life and property casualty products we participate in is over $3 trillion. And so at $19 billion, which is not an insubstantial portfolio, we still represent less than 1% market share in the territories in which we operate. And so clearly, we have room to grow.
We have the franchise we believe to build on this opportunity. And a franchise can be defined in several different ways. And the first way I will describe the franchise to a certain extent is the scale. On the left side of the page here, you see some comments on the property casualty part of consumer, because we are a go-to-market business. We go to market as both the Life and the Property Casualty product range, but we continue to report within the PC and the Life and Retirement segments. But on the Property Casualty side, consumer is really the heart of the international business. At six months of this year, 75% of the PC business outside of the United States is actually consumer business. We have very strong positions in key markets, including the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest markets of the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom. And we have a multi-product, multi-channel strategy that generates great diversity, which benefits our portfolios in many ways.
And on the right side, we have the life, health and disability businesses a sound building block for the future. Right now, our biggest life operation is the United States, where we have great underwriting and marketing expertise and a multi-channel strategy, which is core to our business model. And as you will see later today, a business model that we are now developing here with AIG Fuji Life in Japan. And the life portfolios also represent stable earnings and further diversified risk across the portfolio.
Now, the size and scale of our franchise is one thing, but what about the capabilities in the quality and the experience. I would like to provide some background information on the components of this Global Consumer franchise. First, our travel insurance business. We have a leading global travel, medical assistance and security assistance provider we market under the name of AIG Travel Guard. We have been focusing on the travel business since the 1960s. In fact, we have been a participant here in Japan in the travel business since the 1960s. And for a long time, we have focused on what are the customer needs in the travel space and what are the distribution techniques that can be successful.
And one of our hallmarks is that for our business in Japan, we have established a global network of Japanese language doctors as well as Japanese culturally familiar services, so that as our customers from Japan travel around the world, we can provide them the services that they need. This was something that we began doing in the 1970s in the 1980s, not just recently and represents the deep history of our travel franchise. We are building off of that experience as we expand our travel franchise, for example, into China now, which is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest outbound travel market or anticipated to be the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest outbound travel market in the next 10 years and one of the fastest growing.
We also have a unique capability to launch multi-country programs to serve the providers in the travel businesses. And just this week, we simultaneously launched a program for one of the airlines best known for customer service in the world in 22 different countries, a full blown mobile and digital offer that within minutes of its launch had already contracted its first policies. We have taken our experience from travel services and expanded that into our extended warranty services franchise, which started as a country by country operation, but it evolved into a business that\xe2\x80\x99s now focused on mobile communications, electronic devices, and multi-country programs. And in the last 12 months, we launched a program serving one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s best known innovators and retailers in 17 different countries for the services that we provide have become an important part of their value proposition.
In addition, a lot of companies talk about accident and health, personal accidents and supplemental health has been a focus of AIG since the 1960s. We had many long-term distribution partnerships and alliances that go back over 40 years. For example, here in Japan, we have been working with the Hojinkai, the Small Business Taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 Association as well as with the Daido Life Insurance Company since the early 1970s. For long time, we have had a partnership with the Japan Travel Bureau, one of the biggest travel agents in the world, in such a great relationship that we decided to form a partnership together in a permanent foundation of our relationship. This type of relationship development doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist only in Japan it exists all over our franchise. And for example in the United States, some educational institutions, some volunteer associations, including firemen and policemen and some other relationships go back over 50 years with the foundation of our A&H portfolio.
In addition, in terms of distribution, in distribution and developments, we have long been a pioneer in direct marketing. Our first direct marketing license here in Japan was issued in 1982 under the American Home Assurance company. And not only here in Japan, but in other countries, we have been a pioneer first in drop-outs from newspapers, in radio, in television, in telemarketing and now in digital and mobile spaces. This is a substantial part of our portfolio we have talked about over the last couple of years and continues to be a rapidly evolving space.
We have a very highly regarded network provider in the United States under the name of the Private Client Group. We ensure around 40% of the country\xe2\x80\x99s billionaires. We ensure some of the most important collectors in the country. We have very strong risk management practices, unique capabilities, such as our wildfire protection units, which physically tracks where fires occur in the Western United States. And if we identify a home that we ensure and we are in the path of the fire, we can take actions to protect that home by spraying the foundation or the roof with chemicals and preventing damage. So, we are using our risk expertise to help our customers reduce our cost of risk.
And finally, one of our greatest assets is the data that we have access to. So, we are beginning to unlock the tremendous value at all of the sources of customer and distributor and behavioral data that we have. And so when I say we have the unique franchise, a franchise difficult to duplicate, this is the value of our franchise.
In terms of financials, I will first talk about the Property Casualty business, because it\xe2\x80\x99s maybe the most well-known portion of consumer. And I\xe2\x80\x99d like to draw your attention to the bottom right part of the page. In the last couple of years, we have focused on getting the foundation right, so that we have a solid foundation on which to grow. And as you can see, we have enjoyed an improving loss ratio and we will talk about that in a while related to our data-driven pricing. In addition, from the numbers at the top half of the page, you can see they are consistent with the rest of AIG strategy, our emphasis is on value and not on volume. We focus on risk-adjusted accretive business that returns excess of our cost of capital and the results can be seen in the improving underwriting trends as well as in other aspects that I would demonstrate to you today.
And talking of portfolio diversity, the next page is actually a combination of the portfolio with the go-to-market approach, including Life as well as Property Casualty. And we can see here that our emphasis is on diversification. Around 59% of the portfolio is the life and accident and health portfolios very stable sources of income. But on the right side of the page, you can see the regional distribution. The Americas and Asia-Pacific each representing just shy of 45% of our portfolios driven by the large markets of the U.S. and Japan.
In terms of diversification within the product lines, the short tail nature of our Property Casualty Consumer business is very attractive and contributes tremendously to our business diversification, as well as our capital diversification opportunities. There is almost an even split between personal lines and accident and health businesses. And as you can see on the right side of the page, Japan is a tremendous contributor to the Property Casualty Consumer businesses, the largest contributor to the consumer businesses. And the overall portfolio of $6.7 billion we are just shy of 4% from the first 6 months.
In terms of the life portfolio, this is primarily our U.S. Life and A&H business as reported. It\xe2\x80\x99s also a story of diversification. You can see the product diversification on the left side as well as the channel diversification on the right side. It\xe2\x80\x99s long been our strategy to manage channel diversification. You can see we span from career agents, independent general agents, broker dealers and banks, independent broker general agents and also consumer direct and digital marketing across the U.S. portfolio. When my colleagues talk about Japan this afternoon, you will see that we are beginning our channel diversification in our life insurance portfolios here. And our property casualty portfolios have long benefited from significant distribution diversification. Our U.S. Life strategy is a story of stability. We have intended on developing modest growth. We have a conservative portfolio and we are generating steady earnings as can be seen from the numbers and the results on this page as reported previously.
Now, another look at our franchise is by region. So, here we have the Americas, predominantly commercial insurance business that the consumer portfolio is very important. I mentioned Private Client Group and you can see some of the statistics there and we have the travel insurance business, a very large and successful warranty business, and of course, our foundation portfolio of accident and health, which includes business travel accidents, education markets, healthcare markets and specialty groups.
The next region, Asia-Pacific, some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s fastest growing markets. We have a solid track record of success. Some of our success is relevant to our emphasis on customer service and we have received excellent external recognition for our performance there, including for 6 years in a row the JD Power Customer Satisfaction Award for automobile insurance, claims experience here in Japan. In addition, other awards to our franchises across the region.
Second thing I would like to draw your attention to is our distribution, development and innovation, including our unique relationship with the People\xe2\x80\x99s Insurance Company in China now in its 10th year, where we have a strong partnership in the accident and supplemental health businesses and more recently announced a life insurance joint venture to develop distribution in that fast growing marketplace. And finally, we have targeted scale. We don\xe2\x80\x99t try to achieve scale in all markets, but in markets where the opportunity exists, we do develop a full product range scale oriented operation such as in Singapore, where we are the largest general insurance provider.
In EMEA, we have lots of opportunities in this very large and wealthy market: Europe, Middle East, and Africa. As you can see, AIG\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio was still primarily commercial. However, we\xe2\x80\x99ve recently made tremendous strides there, including the previously announced partnership with HSBC in Turkey, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s fastest growing markets, as well as our pending acquisition of Ageas Protect, an innovative, nimble platform in the UK, the third largest life and savings market in the world. So, we have a diverse, unique, and difficult to duplicate franchise. And we have been focusing on improving our underwriting results.
Now, turning to the next page, some of our activities in underwriting area. Some of these tools will likely be familiar to you, because they are similar to tools that have been successfully used in AIG\xe2\x80\x99s commercial portfolios for the last couple of years. And in some of the earnings calls, I have commented on the fact that we and consumer are learning the lessons and deploying and applying similar tools, although we are at slightly earlier stages of developments. But the reality is our portfolios are shorter term. And so we are able in some cases to see the impact of our underwriting results visibly, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s enhanced grade level reviews, enhanced grading structures, standardized global radars, advanced catastrophe pricing, or price optimization strategies, we are leaning from developing the tools necessary to optimize this portfolio. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t try to do everything everywhere. We recognize that we have to balance our initiatives and we have prioritized using a risk-based approach focusing on the biggest opportunities in the biggest markets. And these results are leading to stability in our loss ratio albeit of some natural event-driven barriers.
There is a few key points on this accident year, excluding cats and PYD page results as reported. But first is that over the last 3 years, although the loss ratio has moved around a little, it\xe2\x80\x99s within a very narrow band, on the high end 60.7, on the low end 55.7 again accident year, excluding cats and PYD. And there are a few events, but largely stable to improving trends. You can see the comment on the weather-related claims in early 2012 or as earlier reported warranty situation in the United States, where particular product changed in its experience and we moved very quickly, both negotiating with our customers and taking underwriting actions to respond to that change. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s now starting to earn through the portfolio.
We had a state of unusual weather late in 2013. And of course in the second quarter of 2014, where we have started to see the benefit earning in from the hard work that has been done here in Japan in the last couple of years, which my colleague Tim will provide more information about, as well as our underwriting actions in the large market of the United States. We have reached sustainable competitive loss ratios in most of our major products. And we continue active portfolio management, data investments and enhancing our tools as we continue to optimize the portfolio. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s the close of our second message. We are confident that our data-driven pricing is a sustainable strategy.
The third message, actually, we have a broad and a diverse business and we have plenty of opportunities. And so one of the things that we have worked on is developing an appropriate framework, which we determine how to prioritize our actions, how to prioritize our investments and we call this tool the market maturity model. Well, I apologize that this slide was a little bit noisy. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to describe it. Essentially, what we have determined is that markets develop in a certain way, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the products that are available, the channels that exist or are viable in the customer segments, which are appropriate, the certain insurance products and channels evolve over time. Now, we are not na\xc3\xafve. We know every market doesn\xe2\x80\x99t evolve in a linear fashion and you can\xe2\x80\x99t necessary plug a country into a specific place in this model at anytime. However, it is instructive in terms of taking a large and diverse portfolio such as AIG has in identifying what are the various characteristics that determine which products and channels we should be mobilizing in a particular market. And so we have mapped our enterprise to reflect where we believe they are on the continuum and then optimize by market accordingly.
I would like to provide sort of a few examples of how this works in practice. First, on the left side of the page, right, there is many markets that are in early stages. Sometimes, these are fast growing markets. The populations are at a stage where they may not be able to afford the more sophisticated products or the overall opportunity size may not warrant the investments in the infrastructure for some of our more sophisticated products. And so in those places, we focus on areas like accident, personal accident and travel insurance, warranty insurance, programs which are relatively low cost to administer, many of which are multi-country distributor partner in nature and where we can access mass distribution, sponsor distribution, or travel industry distribution, service program providers.
A few examples of markets such as this that are now in the process of potentially transitioning to the next stage, including many or what we used to call strategic business expansion units, the SBUs, such as Turkey and Colombia and Mexico. The next phase as the market develops is a very important one, because as the market matures the opportunity becomes viable to invest in some of the more sophisticated business. In most cases, that starts with automobile insurance.
We have to be careful about making decisions, where and how to invest in automobile. It\xe2\x80\x99s a challenging line of business. It also requires investments in the appropriate systems, actuarial skills and capabilities, claims management practices, etcetera and we don\xe2\x80\x99t underestimate those. Also distribution becomes more mature as the models evolve. And we have several examples of portfolios that are at this stage, where we have almost the full suite of the Property Casualty Consumer products available and where we are growing our market position. And Greece, Israel and Ireland are three examples. But we are not just boot stamping out the same model everywhere, we remain market sensitive. And although these are three countries, which we consider at similar stages in the market maturity continuum, our business model is different in each.
In Greece, we primarily work with agents. In Israel, because of the way that market has developed, we primarily focus on direct marketing. And in Ireland, we have a combination of direct marketing agency and independent distribution, all three equally attractive, equally successful operations. And where great opportunity lies for us is on the right side of the page, the world\xe2\x80\x99s mature or the world\xe2\x80\x99s fast growing markets that have reached the stage of maturity in the insurance marketplace of distribution and product. And this is where we have the opportunity to enter the life, health and disability product lines. We have to make careful investment decisions, because once we decide to enter the life business and we accept policy number one, we realize we have to be committed to that market for 20 or 30 years to serve those customers. And so, there will be fewer countries that qualify for our investments in these areas.
Distribution is much more sophisticated, including in some cases, the very capital-intensive developments of career distribution, as well as working with independent advisors in institutional sales. And these represent some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest markets, the U.S., the UK, and importantly Japan. And so Japan today is our deep dive and it is a great example of the consumer insurance strategy at full bloom. It\xe2\x80\x99s in early stages because of the early stages of our acquisition of Fuji Fire & Marine, including AIG Fuji Life, but it is representative of the opportunity of this strategy.
So, in conclusion I will reaffirm, we believe we will successful because we have a unique franchise, one that will be very difficult to duplicate, especially our relationships and our experience, but we are successfully deploying a data-driven strategy and we are starting to see the results. And third, we have a model by which to target our growth. So that we can remain balanced between growth, profitability, and risk and maximize the risk adjusted returns to our shareholders. Thank you very much. And I am happy now to take your questions.
So, I think we have a couple of microphones I found here in front.
Jay Gelb - Barclays
Thank you. Jay Gelb from Barclays. On Slide 10, we have got an accident year first half combined ratio of around 99, what do you think that should be? It seems high. And then on Page 20, you have shown the accident year loss ratio improved the past two quarters, what do you need that to be?
Kevin Hogan
So, as I said, we have done a lot of work on the loss ratio. I believe our loss ratios are at competitive and sustainable positions in most of our major products and major markets. The 99, I will remind you in the first half of this year, we had a state of severe losses in the U.S. personal property portfolio that we are quite unusual. It was the first quarter I think in 27 quarters, in which we have had more than a single severe loss and in fact we have three, which times up the aggregate loss ratio for the first half of the year.
Jay Gelb - Barclays
Okay. But Kevin, where does this business need to be in the combined ratio level for you to hit a target for ROE? I mean, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are trying to get at?
Kevin Hogan
So, similar to what has been disclosed and what AIG describes is our position, we based our focus on an economic model. We are working towards contributing to AIG\xe2\x80\x99s movement towards achieving a risk adjusted return excess of our cost to capital rather than stating a specific combined ratio target. Actually, we do continue to work on all aspects of our business in optimizing the economic returns. So, we use a risk-adjusted profitability measure to determine our pricing models and our underwriting strategy.
Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank
Hi, Kevin. Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. On the second quarter conference call, Peter Hancock mentioned and looking at Slide 20 here, that investors should expect an elevated consumer insurance accident year ratio for 3Q \xe2\x80\x9814, because of seasonally high losses in the Japanese auto market. If I look at historically, third quarter seems to be the best quarter for Japanese auto results not the worst. So, I am wondering to the extent what did you mean by the third quarter being seasonally high for losses? And two, when we look at the improvements in the first half of 2014, how much of that is profits orientation getting down the results and how much of that will be seen then in 3Q mitigating that seasonally high loss trend that you see in third quarter?
Kevin Hogan
Okay. I think that what Peter\xe2\x80\x99s comments were really driving at and the reality of it is the second quarter, which is in many cases I think seasonally improves the weather. It is something that has to do with that. The miles-driven is something that is also relevant to that and the gas price in Japan has had an impact on the miles driven. And so, second quarter was a low frequency quarter. I believe that if we return to historic norms, the second quarter level is unlikely to necessarily be sustained throughout the year.
Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank
And so third quarter won\xe2\x80\x99t be particularly a spike compared to 3Q \xe2\x80\x9813, I mean, I can make a forecast, but we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily prepare for elevated results in 3Q?
Kevin Hogan
We certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t predict the future, but the second quarter was unusually low as a result of a variety of factors, including the miles driven and also the historical fact that second quarter is generally a better weather quarter.
Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank
So, I know that\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to say, but looking at 2Q \xe2\x80\x9813 being at 60.2% and 2Q \xe2\x80\x9814 we have 55.7%, how much of that was profits oriented improvement and how much of that was a very good 2Q for weather and miles driven?
Kevin Hogan
Well, if you are looking across this portfolio, the Japan auto is an important contributor, but also the U.S. warranty business is relevant. And we did have a spike in warranty losses in the second and third quarter last year, which we have disclosed. And so the underwriting improvements that have taken place in warranty also contributed.
Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank
Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. (indiscernible), Credit Suisse. On non-Japan and Asia, it\xe2\x80\x99s 11% of your global consumer portfolio I\xe2\x80\x99d argue is the highest growth potential out of all the markets you are in. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a very fragmented early stage market in many countries. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got regulators trying to consolidate the market and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got detariffication of motor in China and Malaysia as examples, which was to be, I think catalyst for companies like yourself for the skill set you have to create opportunities for you. So given you didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention the Asian countries in the developing and emerging part of the slide you got up there, can you talk a bit about non-Japan, Asia and your focused growth strategy and which markets builds you where you would like to potentially grow and where you see the opportunities for you?
Kevin Hogan
Sure. Well, getting back to the maturity model, depending up on the state evolution of the market, we have different opportunities. But in all markets, we have the opportunity in travel insurance and warranty services, which are two global franchises that we have. And we have begun to rollout some of these multinational programs in various territories across Asia. In our markets, where we are investing in the development of the multiline offer, we have a substantial presence in Singapore and Malaysia to build off of. These are very important opportunities for us. And in China, we have two unique opportunities. We are among the first companies to have a telemarketing license for automobile insurance in China. And so whilst it\xe2\x80\x99s at early stages, we are in the process of piloting total marketing in two different provinces in China. And also we have the relationship with PICC, which has the accident and health aspect of it, which is a relationship that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing for 10 years, but more recently, we have the opportunity to develop a life insurance distribution company. So, our primary focus is on building off of the capabilities that we have in most places where we have them, as well as expanding the global franchises in the more emerging markets. I think there is a question down here?
Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein
Hi. Thank you. Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. I will follow-up a little bit with the conversation around sort of targets in profitability and where we are going. I really liked your Slide 19, which was a bunch of different details on how you guys are driving for future \xe2\x80\x93 presumably for future profitability. And I was wondering if you could walk us through just little a bit more color how to interpret this? In particular, I mean, if we could give us any sort of anecdotes or have a sense of like how much impact each of these individuals levers might have? But in particular, I kind of ask around the enhanced rate level review, I imagine that\xe2\x80\x99s the one that is most important and it drives the \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s most important for driving margins. It looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s already implemented in most of your big drivelines. So, I was kind of curious linking back to some of the comments we have already had, are you guys satisfied with your current \xe2\x80\x93 I mean one, can you walk us through this? But then two, does this imply that you are already satisfied with the level of profitability to drive the consumer? Thank you.
Kevin Hogan
Great, thanks. First of all, I will be satisfied. I think that we have to look at the portfolio of loss ratio and other components. So, we have been working on improving the loss ratio unless we are never satisfied, but we do believe that with the disciplines that we have implemented in the last couple of years, we have reached competitive levels that we are \xe2\x80\x93 that are sustainable, but we will continue to work on further refinements and improvements and we have opportunities to do that. Of the various tools and techniques, actually enhanced rate level review is important and in ensuring that we maintain rate adequacy in advance of the cost of inflation on claims is a critical part of the strategy, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t underestimate the importance of the rating structure, because rating structure can also lead to segmentation changes, which we can operationalize into the business. And so it\xe2\x80\x99s not purely a matter of the actual rates structures themselves, but then what that facilitates in a marketing offer in selecting the customers that we believe will have the best risk-adjusted profitability.
And then so clearly the automobile line of business is one which is most sensitive or among the most sensitive to price and that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the areas that we have worked on a lot fair. Representative of some of the actions that we have taken and I think Tim Schiltz this afternoon will describe the results in our automobile and accident and health business here in Japan, but we have adopted a process of regular reviews even were previously they may not have been determined as necessary, right, for portfolio that historical, may have been profitable, but may have been well in excess of our profit expectations, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t opportunities to further optimize. And so we have gone beyond the level of the obvious and they are now working on optimization and portfolios that may already otherwise be profitable. And we have been able to continue to work on those areas. In some cases, we have products out there that we may not have filed for a rate review in several years in some case longer than several years. Yet the opportunity is there in restructuring the rate filings to then be able to improve our optimization of the portfolios.
So, I think that the rate level reviews and the disciplines around rates have yielded the results of just regular improvements and rates to keep up that lost cost inflations plus further optimization on portfolios that are attractive portfolios for us. And the rating structure is something that has improved our ability to attract customers in the segments that we prefer that have the better margins. The standardized global radars are important for the global businesses and to a certain extent, this is one of the opportunities that we have in the global businesses to pool the experience and build off of that pooled experience. So, some of our strategies are specific market-to-market, other are the strategies that built off of that pooled global experience. So, I hope that provides some insight.
Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you, Kevin. If I could ask just one follow-up, I think people have asked you already for your targets and you guys can\xe2\x80\x99t give them, I understand, but if I were to ask you in sort of a different way, which is when you think about you had strategic planning for your business, you look across your portfolio of businesses and some of these are clearly specialty businesses, things like warranty and travel and accident and health, a lot of competitor \xe2\x80\x93 high networks, lot of competitors in these businesses get high 80s, low 90s kind of combined, auto in Japan more challenging. When you think across \xe2\x80\x93 when we think about all of your challenges, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s need to get to scale or invest in the business, what do you think is possible and what should we be thinking about as long-term sort of the opportunity here in this business? Thank you.
Kevin Hogan
So, the long-term opportunity of this business is for us to carefully build off of the franchise that we have. We are already leveraging the global franchise in travel and in warranty by multiplying the number of partners that we work with. So, warranty is a good example. We innovated the opportunity to simultaneously provide services in 17 different countries on a standard basis for one particular retailer or one particular manufacturer I should say, but we have now extended that capability to other similar manufacturers and also to retailers. So, we are leveraging the infrastructure that we build for multiple transactions. And it takes quite a lot of work in terms of legal contractual work, systems investments etcetera to enable a program like that. So, the efficiency gains on the second, third and fourth programs are substantial.
Same thing with respect to the airline programs, the airline programs that I mentioned we just launched this week is not the first multi-country airline deal. It is probably the largest that we have done to-date, but it\xe2\x80\x99s using the same infrastructure that we put in place for regional programs and global programs in the past. So, I believe that we have an opportunity to optimize in terms of efficiencies by using the capabilities that we have for greater scale and creating economies of scale. And that also is an opportunity as we add lines of business. We are not representing all of the lines of business in all of the markets, which for example in the United Kingdom, where we have a very substantial property casualty operation. We recently made the decision to acquire an acquisition that\xe2\x80\x99s pending with Ageas Protect. This will allow us to leverage also the customer bases, the distribution channels, the capabilities that we have bringing their unique skills and capabilities straight through processing etcetera, such that we can gain efficiencies of scale out of the platform that we already have in place. So, in terms of our overall acquisition costs, our expenses, we can certainly improve our efficiency by increasing our scale. Okay. Other questions in the back yet?
Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan
Hi. Jimmy Bhullar, JPMorgan. I had a couple of questions. First on your \xe2\x80\x93 I think you mentioned you expect the loss ratio to stay stable. I was a little surprised since over time it seems like accident and health is a product that you are currently growing should have better just given the business mix shift your loss ratio should get better over time just naturally? The second question on Page 10, you show a slide with this operating income for the global consumer business, maybe if you could talk about how the operating earnings compared to cash flow that the businesses are generating, especially outside of the U.S.? And what\xe2\x80\x99s your ability and intent to bring that capital to the U.S. versus just leaving it in international markets?
Kevin Hogan
Okay. So, the first question on the loss ratio, what I said is that, we believe that we have sustainable and competitive loss ratios by our major product lines and major businesses. In terms of improving loss ratio based on mix, we certainly have that opportunity. And so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to suggest that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the opportunity to manage the product mix, certainly we will and we do. In terms of the cash flows, as you know, we have a global capital management strategy and we determine where the best risk-adjusted returns are and we use our global liquidity and capital management strategy accordingly. So, specific results of the consumer business are not necessarily relevant to the overall question of cash flows and capital management.
Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan
And my question is more about, if you think about the earnings that you are generating outside of the U.S. in the consumer business, how close are they to real cash that the business is generating and what you are doing in the cash? Do you intend to take it back to the U.S. or do you \xe2\x80\x93 would you leave it here to invest for growth or acquisitions or whatever else?
Kevin Hogan
Well, again, that gets back to the capital management strategy. I think that the \xe2\x80\x93 in terms of the earnings versus the cash flows, what many of these portfolios except for the supplemental health portfolios, some of the accident and supplemental health portfolios are relatively short-term in duration. And so I think that the fact that the liabilities are relatively short-term in duration largely speaks for itself.
Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan
And then just one more on what\xe2\x80\x99s your desire for acquisitions in the international consumer markets? And if you have \xe2\x80\x93 if you have a desire for acquisitions, what are the markets or regions that are the most attractive?
Kevin Hogan
Well, obviously, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we historically comment on that. What I will say is that acquisitions are important potential part of the strategy, where they are consistent with the strategy, where there is an opportunity to stand on capabilities that we have or to complement the capabilities that we have and obviously most attractively where we have the right price. In addition in the consumer business, acquisitions that bring along substantial distribution opportunities can also be consistent with the strategy. Okay, Jay, one more?
Jay Gelb - Barclays
Thank you. Jay Gelb from Barclays. If Scotland becomes an independent country, is that what is the impact on AIG?
Kevin Hogan
I am not going to predict what the outcome is going to be, but I think that\xe2\x80\x99s there are broad discussions around the contractual measures that would depend on what the nature of the determination is, depending upon the outcome as to how the process will unfold. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think AIG is alone being aware that we need to be prepared for multiple outcomes. Okay, one more back yet and then I think we are going to wrap it up after this.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse
Hi. Tom Gallagher, Credit Suisse. Just from flipping through the slides, it looks like the majority of your A&H business is actually accident. Most of the other companies, who have presented this week, are more health. So, we have been hearing how terms and conditions are softening, but you are curious what that environment looks like for you on the accident side?
Kevin Hogan
Okay. Well, it is true we have strong components of the portfolio in personal accident that has been something that we have very carefully focused on for many, many years. But the fastest growing part of our portfolio is in fact the supplemental health portfolio that\xe2\x80\x99s here in Japan and elsewhere. And I think my colleague, Tim, this afternoon, will provide more information and insight with respect to our third sector strategies here in Japan, but it continues to be a very important part of the strategy. With the demographics, the aging around the world, we actually \xe2\x80\x93 we have been working in a variety of markets on products that are appropriate through the senior space. And we have some track record of success there. But health and supplemental health is a significant opportunity for us, because it is not a substantial part of our portfolio right now. And so, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a great deal of influence to protect and we can adopt more disruptive strategies.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse
Just as a follow-up, so but is the accident market a hard market right now? Like what are pricing trends like right now? I think there was a slide, I flipped there a little further on that looks like the loss ratio has shown steady improvement. So, just curious what it looks like right now?
Kevin Hogan
Historically, the personal accident market has not been all that price sensitivity of the market. It\xe2\x80\x99s a market that\xe2\x80\x99s much more driven by marketing and positioning. And so, I think that the margins have been consistent in the accident, personal accident business. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a common trend, not just here in Japan, but in many places. It\xe2\x80\x99s a slightly different line of business than many.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse
Thanks.
Kevin Hogan
Okay, alright. So, today I will let you introduce the break, I guess.
Jose Hernandez - President and Chief Executive Officer, Asia-Pacific
Alright. Thank you, Kevin. So, if there were any questions that you are keen to ask, hold them up, we will do it at the closing Q&A session after the Japan presentations. And I think after our callers from Japan made their presentation, I think that will give additional context to some of the things that Kevin shared with us. So, we can pick that up there. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we take a short break? And if we can get back here in 10 minutes, that would be great. Thank you.
(Break)
Jose Hernandez - President and Chief Executive Officer, Asia-Pacific
Thank you. We are running a little bit behind schedule. So, I just wanted to start again fairly quickly. So, as I mentioned before the second part of the presentation will provide all of us with an overview of our operations and strategy in Japan. The presentation is going to be shared by three of my colleagues. So, what I am going to do is I am going introduce the three of them now and then allow them to deliver their presentations and kind of pass the presentation along to each other.
Leading off the Japan overview and strategy will be Robert Noddin. He is the President and CEO of AIG Japan. Bob began his career at AIG back in 1985 and has held a number of roles of increased responsibility in New York and throughout Asia. His experience in Japan dates back to 2002, when he first served in an operations and systems leadership position. Following Bob, will be Tim Schiltz, Japan\xe2\x80\x99s Head of Consumer Insurance. Tim has over 30 years experience in the insurance industry mainly in the life and retirement space. Since 2000, Tim has focused his efforts \xe2\x80\x93 his efforts have been focused here in Japan and he is currently based in Tokyo. And closing out the Japan operations and strategy session will be Naomi Matsuoka. Naomi is AIG Japan\xe2\x80\x99s Chief Transformation Officer. Naomi recently joined AIG and brings an extensive experience in investment banking, especially as a trusted advisor to companies in Japan looking to improve their capabilities and to transform. So, to get us started on the Japan overview, Bob Noddin.
Robert Noddin - President and Chief Executive Officer, Japan
Thank you, Jose. Welcome back. Had Kevin handed it off to me, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to fix the mic, but Jose is significantly taller, so bear with me. Thank you, Jose for stealing my notes. Tim, Naomi, and I have the privilege to introduce you to AIG Japan today. And we want to focus on what makes us different to other AIG businesses around the world and what makes us different in the market here in Japan.
I am going to touch on through this process, a quick overview of our history and some of the key major milestones in that process. We will talk about our different businesses here in Japan. We will talk about the context of the Japanese property casualty marketplace and how we sit against that. And then we will talk about some unique aspects of the AIG Japan business. So, this timeline has been skinnied down from an awful lot of things that happened on it, but basically, the intent of this is to give you a context of our long history here in Japan and also to highlight our ability to integrate locally and how we have approached segmentation.
So, obviously, the first date on this slide here is 1946, that was where AIG was the first foreign non-life insurance company here in Japan. We started in serving the unique postwar need supporting the occupation forces. Obviously, the Fuji Fire & Marine organization was founded earlier than that as a local organization and has only recently become a full addition to the AIG suite. In 1971, Kevin mentioned this before and this is kind of a key part of local history for us here in Japan. We partnered with Daido Life Insurance for product development and distribution to address the needs in Hojinkai marketplace, Kevin touched on that briefly. They do have a sister organization or maybe better to say a brother organization in the Kansai, part of the Japan called the Nozei-kyoukai. Effectively that Small Taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 Association in Japan is quite unique to Japan.
In 1989, he also mentioned the partnership with the Japan Travel Bureau, obviously, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest travel companies. And we focused aggressively on how to provide and offer unique offerings in the travel marketplace. Hopefully, to give you a sense for the clear evidence of our experience locally on a long run basis here in Japan with an appreciation for what it takes to become a local partner in the business place here. It\xe2\x80\x99s also a clear evidence of our ability to understand the proper opportunities and how to find segments where we felt we could bring something unique and different in both product and distribution.
In 2002, our initial investment was mainly in Fuji Fire & Marine business. 2011 that acquisition was completed, so quite an extensive period of working together, working with that organization and growing to a greater understanding of what Fuji brings to the marketplace. In 2013 and \xe2\x80\x9814, we completed the localization of the AIU branch and the American Home branch. We completed the creation of the local insurance holding company here in Japan, big milestones for us that will factor into this conversation as we go further on. The stars across the bottom are just trying to highlight several of the more significant innovations and demonstrations of recognized market leadership in Japan in that process.
In 1964, we introduced the first third-party automobile claims capabilities. We also introduced a feeder system of developing a pipeline of professional producers in Japan, we referred to as the independent solicitors or the IS decision, where we have recruited and trained and developed our own sales force, which then graduates and becomes independent producers, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk more about that in a few minutes.
In 1976, we introduced, as Kevin mentioned, as a part of our unique travel franchise, the ability to real time length of the issuance of a travel ticket reservation, with the travel insurance capability. A key part of a lot of the strategies we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked on in the travel business here with our partners.
In 1997, the first license in Japan for differentiating a automobile product through the American Home operation, 2006, the first electronic digital policy issuance in Japan in the industry. The thing I think Kevin mentioned and I will highlight here, which I think is the best indication of how our customers in Japan value our service capability and the role we play for them in 6 consecutive years for the AIU operation recognized as number one in customer satisfaction for automobile claim handling by JD Power. So, these are obviously some of the more significant examples of how we look to bring innovation to the marketplace. Our position we have both the global footprints and the local scale to continue to deliver.
Next slide. A quick sense for our go-to-market positioning in Japan, our footprint here reflects what we believe is quite a unique difference from most other markets we operate in other than perhaps the United States. And it plays to clearly customer segmentation and a diversified distribution capability. As we have previously announced and are actively pursuing the merger of the two largest businesses in Japan, AIU and Fuji Fire & Marine. These two companies are roughly similar in premium size, but quite different in their strengths and Naomi will discuss this in more detail shortly.
The American Home and AIG Fuji Life Consumer businesses were touched on briefly by Kevin. But as mentioned previously, American Home is and has been since its inception a market leader in the direct marketing space. AIG Fuji Life, while a relatively younger business for AIG provided the foundation for further opportunities for us here in Japan and Tim will take you through that AIG Fuji Life piece shortly.
Our One AIG effort in Japan is positioned around how we become a more seamless offering to our targeted customers, how we best leverage our transformation investments in Japan and how we maximize the distribution opportunities of our 39,000 plus agencies. That number reflects both individual producers and multi sales force agents in the business. The actual number of sales people on the street is significantly larger to that and I will give you a little bit sense of that in a few minutes.
The overall property casualty market here in Japan, I was going to say I appreciate that most of you have tremendous life in life insight and experience, but clearly it\xe2\x80\x99s based on some of the questions that Kevin will also have considerable property casualty market experience. This is world\xe2\x80\x99s second largest property casualty marketplace after the United States. It is a mature market, however, it is quite under penetrated here and we have selected growth opportunities, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk on in a few minutes. That under penetration has a lot to do with the traditional nature of large debt in this corporate relationships, which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you will know we refer to as Credit Suisse and their cross shareholders.
If we look at the pie chart in the middle, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that the largest components of the P&C market here in Japan is automobile both voluntary and compulsory, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk how AIG is positioned against that next in a minute. And Tim will talk to you about our efforts to improve the net area shortly. If you look at the right hand side of the page, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see how the market consolidation of the past 10 years or so years has impacted prices. This also should show you that AIG represents only two scale alternative for the largest two local players.
I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you through here at a very high level legal entity view on the left hand side, so this reflects the four licensed insurance companies here in Japan. These operating companies will sit underneath the recently created AIG Japan Holdings, local holding company, and they are supported by a number of other support organizations locally. On the right hand side of the page, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that actions in health number, which Kevin mentioned before, this is the third sector in each cover. Fuji Life has both first and third sector of Life and actually the Medical in that number as well. The fire business here is both consumer and commercial, because the local market does not distinguish between the two. But in the case of AIG, the internal strategies and capabilities to manage them are quite different. The others category here is casualty and other specialty lines such as trade credit, political risk, financial lines, and aviation and environmental products.
Now how does that stack up against the local competitors? While the Fuji Fire acquisition several years ago did expand the size of our automobile share in our overall mix, we are still significantly smaller in auto than the local players. Also that the third sector, accident and health portion has brought a real differentiator to our mix, that impacts both the loss and expense ratio components of our business here in Japan. It carries with it a slightly higher expense ratio acquisition component, but it operates at more attractive loss ratios.
To be clear, the biggest points of note for AIG versus the market are that our automobile portfolio, both the sum of both the voluntary and the compulsory runs anywhere from 8% to 19% smaller than our largest local competitors and our accident and health portfolio runs roughly 13% more in our overall mix. We do think we have that mix right at the moment, but as well as see the demographics presenting new opportunities in the life, medical and commercial space for targeted growth as we go forward.
So, positioning and unique aspects of AIG. So what makes AIG Japan different and how can we succeed in the market so heavily controlled by three local players? As Kevin said earlier, data-driven analytics and segmentation to focus on the right growth opportunities are quite pivotal to our history, our present and our future plans. That gets us to the right risks, with the right balance of growth and profitability. And I will take you through one key example. As Kevin mentioned, we are one of the largest pieces of the overall AIG consumer pie, but please bear in mind, that we are also one of the AIG\xe2\x80\x99s largest commercial operations across the world.
We look materially different in that book from both our product and distribution components to how the rest of our AIG businesses look globally. But that\xe2\x80\x99s also quite true for our comparison against domestic competitors. In order to crack into that commercial market, where so much of the large corporate business was controlled through those keiretsu connections, we need to find the places to play, the products that were needed and the distribution to get those to those places. That\xe2\x80\x99s where the SME that\xe2\x80\x99s small medium enterprise marketplace business has come into play for us here in Japan.
SMEs makeup the vast majority of commercially licensed businesses in Japan and they generally don\xe2\x80\x99t have those keiretsu controlling links. That\xe2\x80\x99s where the partnership with Daido Life dating back to 1971 in the form of distribution and product and the Hojinkai for segmentation and their endorsement to their members have played a key role in helping us find the spots to play in and win. It was also in this space that we focused the development of professional consultative sales capabilities by recruiting and building a professional needs-based sales organization for both independent and internal career producers. That\xe2\x80\x99s quite different from other AIG country operations around the world and that\xe2\x80\x99s not a new strategy for us here in Japan. That\xe2\x80\x99s something we have been doing for the last 43 years.
If we look at distribution, well, in basic order of their contribution to us, let me walk you through that independent agents are just that, these are professional full-time insurance agents. A large portion of those producers have been AIG recruited and developed and trained, ala that independent solicitor component, I mentioned to you previously. Many of them are co-registered with the other property casualty companies here in Japan. So, they have a choice. And many of them are also registered as life providers. The partner channel consists of a variety of non-insurance professional agents whose primary business is not insurance. Examples would be automobile dealers and repair garages, realtors, homebuilders, mortgage brokers, travel agency and so forth. We have partnered with them to produce a seamless insurance sale component to their primary businesses quite successfully.
Direct marketing is also a large part of our franchise here in Japan and that will continue to expand. The American Home operation has pioneered in this space for AIG and is currently working with AIG Fuji Life in exploring new opportunities to leverage that infrastructure. Case agent is something quite unique to Japan, are those into large internal entities of major Japanese corporations that serve to handle placements for all of their related subsidiary risk needs.
Life Alliance is business sourced through the barred and proxied business relationships we have with different life companies, distribution channels here in Japan. And global brokers is just what it says, but you will note that again this reflects the traditional Japanese keiretsu cross-shareholding and the case agents behaviors of the past. We see that changing. And while the speed will accelerate with increased foreign investment into Japan, the influence there we will have in driving true risk management, it will take some time for that to be a large market maker in the future.
So, I come back very quickly to this small medium enterprise business component because it talks very aggressively to our growth strategies, as well as our uniqueness around distribution and segmentation. SMEs are a clear growth component of the market in Japan, both in terms of size and penetration opportunities. Our outside in efforts in this area teamed with science-based analytics and considerable history have allowed us to target both industry and geographic segments for profitable growth.
We had those targeted businesses to tell us what they need and why, how they prefer to buy and from whom, and what matters most, price or convenience? We have reconfigured our product offering to reflect the coverages. They express the most interesting and the need for combining those coverages into things such as group PA, property liability and so on. And we made that product flexible and industry tailored. We punch above our weight in this segment and we do so because of these factors and recognition of the partnering needed to bring something new to the marketplace. This has a new space during the economic boom period, was centered around key man coverages. As the demographics and global economy have changed, they need to change with it. We have adapted to offer those tailored capabilities into those preferred segments that cut across consumer and commercial products and through consultative risk advising and distribution that we have built and we have equipped ourselves.
To give you a similar sense for our consumer business in Japan, I will ask Tim Schiltz to come up and walk you through his business in more detail. Thank you.
Tim Schiltz - Head, Consumer Insurance, Japan
Thanks Bob. As was mentioned, the Japan consumer business is the second largest consumer business in AIG. It\xe2\x80\x99s well-diversified between the property casualty and the life and A&H businesses. Today, I will focus on our two largest consumer portfolios in Japan, auto and A&H, also briefly introduce the key growth engine for our Japan consumer portfolio, AIG Fuji Life. Across all our Japan consumer businesses, we utilized data-driven analysis to focus on portfolio management, actual rate adequacy, producer management, and targeted growth opportunities that balance profitability growth and risk.
While auto loss ratios vary somewhat each quarter due to seasonality, the rolling 12-month loss ratio shown in this chart are more smooth, but the overall trend indicating an improvement in the range of around 4 points post the acquisition of Fuji Fire & Marine. As this trend is very strong, let me spend a minute explaining how we got here and what it implies for future actions. The acquisitions of Fuji Fire & Marine gave us a much larger auto portfolio as well as an opportunity to instill the AIG culture of strong analytics and corresponding underwriting and pricing actions. After the acquisition, our portfolio management analytics indicated a need to tighten underwriting on certain less profitable segments of the market. Our actuarial analysis showed areas where we need to take rate and we implemented these several times in the past few years to drive down the loss ratio. In addition, we introduced new pricing segments and buried the underwriting authority by agent depending on the quality of the business that they wrote.
At the same time, the entire Japan auto industry has benefited from various external factors that are driving down the frequency of auto accidents and claims as well as increased prices for the compulsory automobile liability insurance. A combination of our internal actions and these external drivers contributed in total to the loss ratio improvement in the portfolio. Given these results, we do not see a need for additional underwriting or rate actions outside of our normal portfolio management process as we continue to balance process risk and growth. And speaking of growth, now that the auto portfolio lost ratio is in line with our pricing assumptions, we are in a position to grow our business in targeted consumer segments.
Accordingly, there are several catalysts driving recent growth in terms of number of new vehicles being insured. As a result of some of prior actions we talked about on the prior slide, AIG\xe2\x80\x99s auto block did not require the same level of price increases of the industry at the end of last year. So when competitors raise rates, our agents were able to take advantage of the relative competitiveness. We have been training and recruiting more of our agents to take a customer segment approach and offer AIG products that are needed, including auto.
We have expanded auto sales in the insurance shop distribution channel and finding early success there. We have added a position in the organization specifically to drive new business growth in auto, providing clear and consistent messages to the agents about how to grow auto sales including additional training and incentives around the segments that we believe are most profitable. The increase in the number of the new vehicle sales is a leading indicator of new business growth. Combined with improving retention, we\xe2\x80\x99re now getting to the point where our auto portfolio could be growing for the first time in many years. Similar to our auto portfolio, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen improvement in our A&H loss ratios by utilizing analytics and taking appropriate underwriting and rating actions. As with the auto portfolio, our A&H loss ratio is now in a sustainable range that will enable us to grow and focus segments going forward.
Let me highlight a few of the areas we focused on to improve the A&H loss ratio. We created more granular segments within our group personal accident block by occupation and have automated most pricing actions to deliver appropriate rates for each type of occupation. In addition, we have instituted some annual processes in the field to ensure that these actions are effectively instituted by capping discounts in some segments and training underwriters to play surcharges on others.
In the personal accident, travel accident blocks, we further segmented our customers by age to better reflect the actual loss ratios associated with each segment. Again, as our agents are doing more needs analysis with our customers, we are able to sell multiple products package with what used to be just a group personal accident sale to improve the overall profitability. Our personal accident is the vast majority of the current A&H book. Medical and life are becoming a much bigger portion in line with the overall market shift. Much of our growth in these product lines comes from AIG Fuji Life, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll spend a few minutes talking about that now.
AIG Fuji Life has been a growth engine for Japan consumers since shortly after it was acquired as part of the Fuji Fire & Marine transaction. Let me briefly describe the profitability, risk, and growth actions AIG undertook to position this success. After the AIG acquisition, the product portfolio was reprised to meet AIG profitability and risk guidelines, with certain products being discontinued, such as a Japan yen-based fixed annuity that was briefly sold in 2010. During the same period, other products were made more competitive still in line with our profit and risk requirements to enable an expansion into independent distribution channels. AIG Fuji Life currently sells mostly life and medical products that meet the needs of our customers and distributors who are looking for straightforward products at a fair price. Our operating model continues to be built around the needs of these distributors as they service our end policyholders. We see additional opportunity in the future for life, medical, and savings products designed to meet the needs of the growing senior segment in Japan.
This graph describes the shift in distribution channels at AIG Fuji Life since AIG took over the portfolio. At the time of acquisition, most of AIG Fuji Life sales were through Fuji Fire & Marine agents. After revising the product portfolio and refocusing some distributor services, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to penetrate more third party distribution including insurance shops and life product agencies. The overall growth and expansion of AIG Fuji Life\xe2\x80\x99s product portfolio and distribution channels shows the benefit of data-driven decisions around price and risk as well as the focus on targeted growth. Consistent teams across all our consumer products in Japan and you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in this presentation, the Japan consumer business has taken the difficult and disciplined steps necessary to position us for future growth.
And now, I would like to introduce Naomi Matsuoka, who will tell you more about how AIG Japan is planning to transform its operations to further enable that growth.
Naomi Matsuoka - Chief Transformation Officer, Japan
Thank you, Tim. Okay. You have heard from Bob on AIG Japan and Tim on AIG Japan Consumer. Now, let me talk about how this all fits together and how we expect our overall efforts in Japan to create value for our customers and for AIG. I will first discuss how we have reached to where we are, leading into the merger, which is one of the key triggers to realizing our vision for transformation and our strategy to enable that.
Now, it is important to highlight upfront that our journey starts with a focus on the customer with the following three objectives in mind. First, simplify, we are looking to simplify ourselves in order to make it easy and effective as possible for our targeted customers and business partners to do business with us. In the past, our four operating companies in Japan had focused on their unique strengths and have grown in their targeted areas leveraging AIG global capabilities and synergies rather opportunistically. Our legal entity simplification and our merger efforts as discussed will enable real leveraging and collaboration within AIG Japan.
Second, focus on the customer, the customer is there. We are focused on understanding the evolving needs of our target customer segments and are delivering products and services to meet those needs. We will achieve this based on our focus on increased market awareness, customer simplicity and working as One AIG, bringing effectiveness, efficiency and speed to market. Third, differentiate, we are driving real change in the organization across product, culture, technology and services, to delivery on current and future anticipated customer and partner expectations.
We will constantly be innovating and efficient in delivering effective products and services to targeted customer segments in the competitive and mature market in Japan. Although we have made great progress to-date, our transformation agenda will deliver on a series of capabilities that will help us focus on the customer. The merger of AIU Fuji is a great opportunity to drive change and the event in itself enables us to get our organization focused and motivated to succeed. The merger enables us to establish scale and strengthen our position in the market while introducing sustainable expense efficiency gains over time. It thus will enable us to deliver value to our targeted customers in a very aligned and effective way.
Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s review the history. We established first a strategic relationship with Fuji Fire & Marine and later took full control of the company, which was a great opportunity for us and added to attractive valuation, but with the recognition that subsequent investments would be necessary. Subsequent to that, we have been in the process of the preparation work for the merger for Fuji Fire and AIU and as the first step, streamlined our group legal entity structure enabling us to effectively conduct reorganizations leading into transformation.
We have also been engaged in integration work for the merger, which is a highly complex process involving various initiatives and multiple steps. Integration for Japanese companies or Japanese insurance companies more specifically, are required to be conducted fully prior to the merger by laws and regulations. This includes product integration approval, system integration and development, organizational reforms, training and education and extensive testing in the rehearsals, all happening prior to the merger. The merger will bring together the respective strengths in our people, our clientele, distribution, products, claims, operations and technology of the two operating companies. Simplification and consolidation efforts will be the trigger to transform into a value-based customer focused organization. The merger will also drive efficiency in the end-to-end operations and will intense our competitiveness in the market. Now, it is very easy for an organization, which is going through a merger to become too internally focused and tend to neglect its business partners and market focused activities during that time.
So, recognizing that, we are to the contrary actually currently focusing on delivering new market facing tools and services for our business partners and customers. A good example of that is our new agency platform, which will be gradually be rolled out to our thousands of agents across Japan starting from the end of this year leading into the merger. These new capabilities will not only help facilitate the transfer of businesses to the new merged entity, but will also provide agents with new capabilities to grow their businesses.
Now on transformation. Our vision for AIG Japan to lead the market \xe2\x80\x93 is to lead the market in delivering value to our customer by helping customers understand and manage the risk through products and services tailored to their needs with intuitive, simple, and effective customer experience. We look to leveraging our creative value in Japan across the broader in the AIG group as well. Our strategy for vision is threefold as you can see. The first is segmentation and customer simplicity. We will look at our business first and foremost through a customer\xe2\x80\x99s segmented length, individuals, SMEs, and large businesses and target specific sub-segments within these groups, where we believe we have competitive advantage and we are \xe2\x80\x93 and which are attractive to us. We will rely on advanced analytics and science to identify and target these segments, superior marketing skills to develop the right compositions for their needs and diversify points of access for ease of purchase.
Second, unlocking distributions, we will serve our customers through a broad range of owned and independent channels to best deliver on how they want to do business with us and to maximize our available market in this country. This includes non-traditional insurance distributors for whom we can enhance the value of their offerings by integrating insurance into this holistic purchase decisions around key life events and needs. We will deepen relationships with existing distributors by providing more products and cross-sell support, identifying and supporting this penetration of new markets, providing further customer insights relative to further needs and offering greater ease of doing business with us. This will enable us to earn higher distributor and customer shares of their wallets, lower cost of customer acquisitions and improve customer lifetime value.
Third, agility, speed and efficiency, we will continue to innovate around products and services backed by our increased customer segment focus. We will build faster customer feedback loops substantially upgrade our system capability and drive cost and complexity out of our business at all levels for our customers and distributors. It will be based on a new target operating model oriented around customers and designed to streamline and accelerate our decision-making.
So what makes us transform? Transformation is realizing our vision for Japan and implementing strategies to achieve our goal. We will maximize growth opportunities by transforming ourselves, leveraging our capabilities and driving efficiencies and strengthening our competitive edge. We talked about the merger being a catalyst. We are the only company in Japan, where the merger is initiated by the parent and not the conventional subsidiaries creating the parent, which implies that we can lead ourselves to change with the real drive and substance. We believe changing our people and culture is actually the heart of our differentiation. We are building a performance based organizational structure and discipline that aligns our people to division. We are streamlining positions and roles and as well as evaluation criteria and making sure that our leadership exemplifies how our people should think, talk and walk in our organization. We will enhance our segmentation strategy and focus. Through further targeting and leveraging of our distribution, we will rationalize and standardize products for the merger than intense products and services for our targeted customers.
Our targeted segments in terms of industry, location etcetera for SMEs and then age, group, family etcetera for individual customers, we will be aligning our distribution channels towards higher market penetration and focus segments while we enhance cross-selling as well. In addition, we will be focusing all our efforts in investing for penetrating our brand not only in line with the main change of the merger, but towards an instant recognition and brand proposition of AIG Japan in this market as a whole.
With the merger, we will achieve the goals of simplification and consolidation in AIU and Fuji Fire. We will further explore opportunities of driving scale and efficiencies across the other operating companies through information, implementation of centers of excellence, optimize utilization of shared services, and streamlining of our operations. In parallel, the corporate governance and risk management framework here are being strengthened across our organization. We will employ our analytics and science capabilities to help manage our customers risk and become the most valued insurer in our eyes of the customers. So, Japan transformation aims to enhance growth, balancing, profitability, and risk. At the same time, we believe that it is essential that we carefully manage and balance our focus on business as usual, the merger, and transformation.
Now, before Q&A, let me ask Kevin Hogan again to put together Japan and AIG Consumer as a whole.
Kevin Hogan - Chief Executive Officer, Global Consumer Insurance
Well, thanks, Naomi and thanks, Bob and Tim for those presentations, which ladies and gentlemen, I hope provide a context in terms of where the consumer strategy and where AIG Japan kind of come hand in gloves. And this afternoon, we have demonstrated how AIG Japan is really representative of the three pillars of the strategy. We do have a unique franchise here in Japan. We have a long operating history. We have demonstrated success. We have a history of real innovation in products and distribution channels. We have a diversified product and distribution mix with an emphasis on personal accident in the A&H third sector in these segments.
The acquisition of Fuji Fire & Marine is a catalyst to transformation for us. It also provides for access to a life insurance license at an important time of demographic change. We clearly have a data-driven strategy, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s underwriting, pricing, agent managements, our direct marketing businesses, our digital interfaces and the use of our immense customer and behavioral data as represented in the new agency system, which Naomi just described. And third, although Japan is a mature market, our emphasis is on participating in its faster growing segments, the segments of the third sector and of small and medium-sized enterprises, all in a mission to maximize the risk adjusted returns for our shareholders. So, this is how Japan and consumer fit together? This is why we believe we will be successful here with our new strategies in Japan.
And now, I\xe2\x80\x99d be very happy. Thank you for your attention to hand over to Jose who will administer the Q&A for us. Thank you.
Jose Hernandez - President and Chief Executive Officer, Asia-Pacific
So, we are going to bring some chairs up here. So, I can ask the presenters if they can. But in the meantime, in addition to our presenters, we have a number of the key Japan leaders here with us and I am going to ask them to stand up and face the group. I am going to introduce them real quick and for the Q&A session not only will I take on some questions or defer them to our presenters, but we will also be able to reach out to the rest of the leadership team that\xe2\x80\x99s here with us.
Taka Yokoyama, who is the Representative Director and President and CEO of Fuji Fire & Marine. We have Makoto Ozeki, who is the Representative Director and he is the President and CEO of AIU Insurance Company of Japan. (indiscernible) who is the Representative Director and President and CEO of American Home Assurance Company, Japan. (indiscernible) who is the President and CEO of AIG Fuji Life Insurance Company. In addition, we have (indiscernible) who is the Chief Distribution Officer for Japan. Wayne Lewis, who is the Chief Financial Officer of Asia-Pacific and in addition, we have (indiscernible), who is the Executive Corporate Officer and he is the Head of our Commercial Division here in AIG Japan.
So with that, we will be very happy to take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Jeffrey Cho - MFS
Hi. My name is Jeffrey Cho from MFS. So, we heard from several competitors that competition in the medical space is heating up and they actually called out AIG as being one of the most aggressive. And Kevin, you mentioned that you can adopt more destructive strategies, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a backlog. Can you just help me understand the type of margins you are targeting for this book, type of returns and maybe address comments from your peers about AIG being most aggressive?
Kevin Hogan
I hope Tim you are probably in a better position to talk about.
Tim Schiltz
Okay. In the competitive space, where the people that you spoke to like in the insurance shops or in the life pros, I mentioned that we have gone in for some straightforward products at a fair price. And we have really done some unique things there in terms of simplifying the product features that we provide relative to the competitors in terms of the products that we are selling quite a bit of. So especially in our very popular cancer product, for example, we are the first to really focus on a diagnosis, only style benefit that was very simple and straightforward and that people could understand, distributors could understand and was \xe2\x80\x93 and that they have been selling quite a bit. So, we \xe2\x80\x93 as Kevin said, we do priced these at core margins on an economic value as well as looking at other types of accounting basis and the products that we do sell to meet all of the margins that we are shooting for.
Jeffrey Cho - MFS
Is there any way you can give a sense of accident year combined ratios ex-Fuji Life? I am assuming this is a higher margin product \xe2\x80\x93 I will just follow up, I am sorry.
Robert Noddin
On this particular product, no, we don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily measure and disclose any of the loss ratios in Japan at this point in time.
Jeffrey Cho - MFS
Fair to say, Fuji Life is a higher margin product than the overall consumer book?
Robert Noddin
Well, to the extent that we are doing returns on excess capital, the more capital that you put into a business you are going to have higher margins all else being equal. And so we are looking at risk adjusted returns on investor capital. And so to the extent, there is more capital, there could be more margins. And lot of the Fuji Life products are longer and to consume more capital per policy than the shorter duration accident policies or auto policies and other portfolios.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets
Thank you. Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets. It\xe2\x80\x99s on Slide 45, where there \xe2\x80\x93 you kind of transitioned the preparation arrow to the merge arrow. And I appreciated the commentary around that, but I was hoping to kind of get a better sense of how you can describe the upfront cost that comes with that merger and then what the ultimate expense benefit is? I think for those of us who look at the international segment at AIG, the expense ratio would be a key way that the combined ratio would be improved? I appreciate, you can\xe2\x80\x99t give us a forward look there, but I feel like there needs to be a little bit more quantification or specifics around how that comes across?
Unidentified Company Speaker
Now, let me take that and as you have said we don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily focus on providing individual project cost or benefits information. What I could do is I could draw your attention backlog fourth quarter releases, where we \xe2\x80\x93 management team clearly talked about the investments they talked about $250 million that were going to be spend over the next two years associated with the various integration and transformation activities in Japan. And those are continue to be and are on schedule.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets
I guess just a follow-up, so there is no quantified benefit I guess is the first part? And then secondly, I guess you are saying that\xe2\x80\x99s on track, but what is the timeframe where that $250 million upfront merges into a potential benefit?
Unidentified Company Speaker
Well, look, I mean, the whole merger when you talk \xe2\x80\x93 when you heard Naomi talked a little bit about the complexity around the merger in terms of the different steps and activities that you have to go through this merger in Japan, it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult for us at this time to disclose and talk about those benefits. I think what I can do again is if we talk about $250 million that we talked about, those are the upfront costs that we feel confident that are going to be necessary to complete the integration of the project.
Kevin Hogan
So, maybe just \xe2\x80\x93 maybe we take a step back for a short moment, because Jose mentioned in the fourth quarter release and there is a couple of things at play here across the property casualty portfolio, but maybe a tough one to put in context? The first is the acquisition of Fuji Fire & Marine goes back a couple of years. And so this merger and integration process is a part of the continuum of what that has allowed us to do here in Japan as well as described with my colleagues, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s happening across the world of PC. So in the fourth quarter, we announced the $265 million severance charge that\xe2\x80\x99s related to activity taking place across the PC organization. And at the second quarter release this year, we clarified that the benefits from that $265 million severance are anticipated to begin to emerge in the second half of 2015.
With respect to the Japan integration in the fourth quarter, we announced the $250 million relative to that. And in the second quarter we clarified we anticipate a little bit less than half of that being expanded this year with the little bit more than half of that being expanded in 2015. And so I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to recognize the $265 million and the benefits from that versus the Japan integration are really two different sets of projects. And when you look at the benefit of the investments being made in the merger and integration have to go back to the original acquisition of Fuji Fire & Marine, because number of steps had to take place, including the change in the structure of the subsidiaries, creation of the holding company, etcetera. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s one continuum and that continuum is a very attractive investment result overall for AIG.
Jose Hernandez
So, there you go. Please.
Unidentified Analyst
(Indiscernible) Credit Suisse. I have a question in three parts on your P&C business. The first, that your three biggest competitors are at least, 3.5 times your size. So, I just want to get a feel for to the extent to which competitive scale and \xe2\x80\x93 is the competitive advantage to them? And in particular, what the GAAP is around expense ratios and post integration, how much that closes? The second one is around to the extent you have any sort of pricing advantages, segmentation advantages to the extent that there is impediments in the Japanese market to better lineup and fully take advantage of that? And thirdly on, again, when we look around the world, you see these kind of concentrated P&C markets you tend to get very nice pricing environment, which is not the case here in Japan, but we have seen the industry put prices up since 2009 on a very gradual slowed basis, but to what extent do you think? And when we talk to them, the returns are still not great on particularly the auto portfolio. So can you \xe2\x80\x93 and maybe, could you have a view in terms of whether you think that current scenario is likely to continue?
Jose Hernandez
So, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we try to break that into few parts. I think the first part and I will kick this off and then I am going to pass it on to Bob to talk a little bit more about the integration, the expense, and then maybe Tim can talk on the pricing. But what I would say in terms of three times the size, I think Kevin mentioned that in his original remarks, for us it\xe2\x80\x99s about value over volume. So, we are not in a market \xe2\x80\x93 we are not here to compete for market share. As we said, it\xe2\x80\x99s a large mature market here in Japan, but we believe the success is around our focused growth initiatives, not only around the world, but around here in Japan. And we believe that there are a number of very attractive niches for us and I think some of those were touched upon earlier today. I think on the expense and integration, I will pass it on to Bob to kind of address a little bit more specifically.
Robert Noddin
Yes. I mean, I would say that to Jose\xe2\x80\x99s point, Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s point earlier, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put this a little bit into context. If you look at the players in the marketplace, clearly the three local guys control the vast majority of that marketplace. When you look at the outside perspective, with the regulatory perspective on that item with the Fuji Fire acquisition, with the creation of the local holding companies etcetera, the regulator here now views that there are four major players in this marketplace and we are one of those four. So, when they look at market change, when they look at innovation and they look at the future, they have an expectation that somebody needs to bring best practices, global capabilities and innovation to this marketplace, which is not necessarily in the best interests of our large domestic competitors. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be driving that themselves but we believe that while we are not trying to be the biggest, we do believe that as a part of this transformation process becoming more nimble. And as Naomi talked about the agility aspect of being able to bring variety and innovation faster to market is a key part of this process.
If you look at their strategies, they are going through merger processes themselves. None of them are terribly painless. The Tokyo guys have basically come out the other side of that. And they have seen the benefit of those investments from an expense ratio standpoint. We certainly have expectations and desires to see something akin to that. Again, we are not trying to be the biggest, but our message very clearly is we are trying to be the clear alternative. We are trying to be focused on better positioning our offering to be more tailored to what the customers are looking for, offering it to a more professional risk consultative needs-based selling process, which is a message we have heard loud and clear in Japan is that the people are generally getting a little bit of tired of being sold to and want to start talking to people and understanding that the people they are talking to are listening and are bringing a vast array of options to them. We think we are very well positioned to do that. And so it\xe2\x80\x99s from our standpoint it\xe2\x80\x99s not of our size, it\xe2\x80\x99s about our flexibility, our nimbleness and our willingness and frankly, our ability to bring innovation to this marketplace and to drive that change.
Jose Hernandez
Tim, would you like to comment a little bit on it.
Tim Schiltz
On the \xe2\x80\x93 as I mentioned on our auto portfolio, when we acquired the Fuji Fire & Marine block, it was \xe2\x80\x93 tend to be somewhat typical of the Big Three\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio in terms of various underwriting practices and rates and is a very painful process over the last three years for a lot of people in our distribution to actually live through the amount of underwriting changes and rating actions that we had taken. And so as I mentioned, I think that we are now in a very favorable position relative to where we were before with the 4 point decrease in our loss ratio. And so I do think that relative to some of our competitors, everybody has gained from some of the changes in the industry, but I think on a relative basis, we maybe in a position for our own personal pricing to be able to start growth. So, as you saw on the growth slide then, for the three years that we were taking all those actions, our book was \xe2\x80\x93 our new business kept going down and down and down and our renewals suffered as well. Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s all turned around and we are actually starting to see some growth. And so, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the areas that we are targeting for growth, because we are in a range now of sustainable loss ratios.
Jay Gelb - Barclays
Jay Gelb from Barclays. Could you go back to Slide 31? If I look at AIG\xe2\x80\x99s Japan product mix, I think it will be helpful for all of us if you could give us a contextual view of what you view those businesses, their slices of the pie, life, fire, accident, health, auto and the others. What are currently your most attractive businesses and which are in the most need of improvement from the return standpoint?
Jose Hernandez
Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s in a way a very tough question. I think when Kevin was addressing his remarks and the team was talking, we are talking about business mix. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not only about looking at the individual lines of business for us here in Japan, as we start talking about auto and A&H, but it\xe2\x80\x99s talking about the right business mix. And I think the other part that\xe2\x80\x99s really important is the actual segment with them. So, I would say, general terms, I would find that to be a very tough question to answer in terms of what are the ones that we see more opportunity work. In terms of profitability or the need for improvement, I think also Tim and Kevin also talked about and we feel very comfortable, where we were in terms of our underwriting actions that we have taken in our portfolios and we felt that we had a very competitive position in the product mix between the target segments that we were targeting in.
Jay Gelb - Barclays
In order to get the return profile, is there any part of that pie that you feel you need more attention than others currently?
Jose Hernandez
I think \xe2\x80\x93 I am going to see my colleagues at particular comments. What I would say is that, that\xe2\x80\x99s a very, very active, very closely with our distribution partners, it\xe2\x80\x99s understanding macroeconomic conditional behaviors. I think when we talk about data-driven analytics and having deep customer insight, there is really understanding that maturity curve, understanding where our customers are going to go. And that business mix have to be able to change fairly quickly. I think the ability for us, which talks to the underwriting capability and Kevin was explaining about the radars and about the pricing models, it\xe2\x80\x99s our ability to change pricing quickly and our speed to market. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to pinpoint and say it\xe2\x80\x99s that particular, the portfolio is very large and to a certain extent, it\xe2\x80\x99s more about the nimbleness and how we move forward, but...
Unidentified Company Speaker
Let me try to context a few elements of this. First of all, in an overall marketplace as it is clear, automobile is huge in Japan. As Ken and Kevin both mentioned, it\xe2\x80\x99s gone through a lot of change in terms of traditionally or at least for the last four, five years very unprofitable, but a number of factors of that coming to change that equation. I think what lies ahead is more destabilization in some respects. The demographics, the number of license drivers, the increase sales in many vehicles, which our average premiums are significantly lower. The government is focusing on road safety initiatives etcetera. So, there is a whole host of things that are poised to reshape the automobile market in Japan. We think that the decisions that we have taken as Ken mentioned it was not easy for the Fuji Fire producers, for AIG to bring its underwriting discipline and mentality to that portfolio, but we have come out the other side. The growth that you see there has come to several different initiatives both in AIU and the Fuji Fire piece. So, we like where I was going. We like the fact that you see stabilized, because we think that positions us to be quite unique in how we can bring variety if you go out.
The deferred sector piece, you are not shifting. I think one of the questions we heard earlier you are going to not \xe2\x80\x93 a lot of the increasing concern and reservation around the social capabilities of Japan to be able to provide the medical insurance going forward, that puts aging population calls for. So, we see that as continuing to evolve and continuing to shape opportunities. That large demographic position around senior citizens and people of elder age is we believe an opportunity now. I think both in our life businesses and in our property casualty businesses we believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of that and to help shape that future.
On the commercial side of things, we have been very specific in how we target this business. And this is going to be very difficult for us to play in the high end. So, we needed to target what we do in the lower end segment of that and focus on how to get to it and how to provide variation to that. So, while I do believe and we have seen considerable change in the major corporate side of the Japan marketplace, it will continue to move forward at a slower pace than some of the other changes in that marketplace. So, our view is that, there is an awful lot, that\xe2\x80\x99s attracted about this process. Some of it is not about massive growth, but it\xe2\x80\x99s about improving overall profitability in that respect. And when the demographics are flying to windows of opportunity, we think we are well-poised to take advantage of that.
So, I just want to add two things in terms of peer margin. First, as we talked about, we are in pre-merger stage, right. So, we have two sets of a lot of different things and post-merger, we will gain efficiencies. There is no question about that. The second thing is that several years ago, the GAAP accounting rules for direct marketing amortization change. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t slowed down our direct marketing, because we focus on the economic results and not necessarily the accounting results. And so there is certainly an impact in our acquisition cost, because the duration of the direct marketing and the profit streams is longer than just one or two years. And we continue to make the decision based on the economics of the business as opposed to the accounting outcome.
Brian Meredith - UBS
Thanks. Brian Meredith, UBS. Kevin, I am just curious with respect to technology of the analytics, where do you think you are right now relative to your competition in the consumer business that you can focus kind of globally and also Japan? Where you want to be? And then where are we with respect to that investment spent with respect to analytics, there will be a year, two years, three years away from where you want to be? I assume the merger is having some implications as far as your ability to actually build out that fund?
Kevin Hogan
Right. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s a multi sort of oriented question. So, in terms of data and analytics for underwriting purposes and the basics there we are pretty close to where I think we need to be. And I think we are at the leading edge of where the market in the international property casualty stays. And I think largely is, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just the sort of the beginning of the journey. If you look at the tremendous capabilities that we\xe2\x80\x99ve built across PC and science, and some of the ability that we had to leverage back into other of our lines of businesses, at the early stages of turning our attention to leveraging the capabilities of science into the consumer space. We\xe2\x80\x99ve already made good strides in terms of some of our life underwriting practices and some of our marketing optimization, but I think we\xe2\x80\x99re in the early stages, I would say of the deployment of the science initiatives.
In terms of IT, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a mixed bag. The IT is necessary to support the analytics, we are making a lot of investments in, in terms of data records, data warehouses, access to data, we\xe2\x80\x99re at far improved stages than where we were, whereas in terms of the operational systems and in IT, that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why we need to make some of the big investments preparing for the merger and transformation etcetera. As to where we are versus peers, the peers is a big thing, we compete with a lot of different companies in a lot of different markets. There are a handful of companies that are much more attentive to the sort of the front-end use of technology and in interfacing with customers. And we\xe2\x80\x99re making some investments in those areas on the front end.
In terms of interfacing with distributors, I think we are actually at quite a good point, and particularly in our U.S. Life and Retirement businesses, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of our real scope, that we can build off of and expand that around the world. And it\xe2\x80\x99s such a big portfolio, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons why the maturity model and our focus is important, because we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to make these investments everywhere. We are targeting where we make them in terms of what makes sense in a specific portfolio or in a specific opportunity. And so, we maybe early in the journey in some places whereas we are late in the journey in other places, but we are anticipating that the places where we are making the biggest investments are where the biggest returns will be.
Unidentified Company Speaker
I would just add to that, that I think Naomi hit on something that I think you can\xe2\x80\x99t (indiscernible) and that is that challenge really from our standpoint and I think competitively as well in the local marketplace here is that, it\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to make the IT investment. If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t simplified your offering and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t made it more component priced, then it\xe2\x80\x99s an expensive endeavor and changing a little bit of expensive endeavor. And so, an awful lot of the focus, the focus that we have around the merger, around the activities that lead us to that and the expected outcomes coming out of it around how do we drive a value-add from what we offer to the customers that make easier, make it simple? The regulator here years ago, 2009, implemented for the first time in over 100 years, sweeping changes from a product standpoint. Everybody had to re-file their products. Entire focus was on simplifying what we did, making it easier for the customers to understand and trust in the transaction that they were engaged in. People didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, including us at the time, right. But as we look at how we look to go forward, that\xe2\x80\x99s a key component to this. So, concentrating the IT investment is in fact the second step. The first step is simplifying and components are what it is you want to offer, because that will create the agility, that we are looking for in this process and that will create the competitive opportunity to get there faster and different than the competitors.
Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you. Josh Stirling of Bernstein. So, listen Page 46 and 47 really enjoyed the sort of the color around what you guys are trying to do in your transformation. I am wondering though, I mean, in some ways, it was kind of missing the grand simplification that\xe2\x80\x99s here is ultimately what we are trying to achieve, because there is a lot of pieces moving here. And I am wondering when you guys meet with the boards, you meet with your sort of higher ups in the organization, what is the primary driver here? Is this about scale? Is this about getting some expense ratios like you mentioned Tokyo Fire & Marine? Help us understand I guess, not the like 2015/2016 guidance elements of this, but like what are you really going to achieve in the long run or at least what is the goal? And if you can\xe2\x80\x99t give us a financial target, at least maybe if you can give us sense of magnitude with respect to maybe kind of potential headcount reductions or your numbers of systems you would eliminate or something else to try to make this a little bit more tangible? Thank you.
Tim Schiltz
Sure. So, I will be circumspect in how I answer this, but you hit on a couple of key buttons from our standpoint. Clearly, we would like to achieve the scale and our ability to deliver service through our distribution. The traditional approach in Japan from a marketplace standpoint is quite regulated. The context around firewalls and what information can be shared and how products can be distributed etcetera has an awful lot of boundaries around. And so the simpler the organization, the simpler the offering, the more agile and flexibility that we had we bring to our value proposition. Clearly, we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see scale in the way we make investments and the way we deliver on those investments. So, the IT investments, Kevin mentioned, Naomi mentioned, we are looking at that across four separate standalone entities as opposed to a more seamless AIG, we get shared service capabilities out of that, we get capital leverage capabilities, the investment capabilities. We do have a desire and an expectation that we will produce a more agile organization on a lower cost basis. We do believe that the future of Japan is tightly coupled with the future of AIG relative to brand and how it looks to establishing its preeminent view of the most valued insurer in the world and the views of our customers and with views of our shareholders.
So, we have plenty of \xe2\x80\x93 I have plenty of focus from the bosses up above in terms of how we bring that through the merger, but the merger is only a part of it. As Naomi mentioned, as Jose mentioned, the transformation agenda here is I think specific to a Fuji Fire and AIU organization. It is put more broadly around how we use our resources more effectively, how we access those customers in a more diversified fashion, how we give vendee options around how to choose, what to buy, how to buy and when to buy from us, and how we make that an easier or more painless process? So, brand is a component of our thought process. The efficiency is a component of our thought process, and again, the nimbleness to be able to bring offerings to the table without having to come through vertical components on a constant basis. We go to market in the past and it was product by product. I mean, there was a lot of expertise and a lot of capabilities, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t see that as what the customers are asking for. And we don\xe2\x80\x99t see that\xe2\x80\x99s how we will just maximize distribution as we go forward.
Kevin Hogan
And so I think ultimately if we can become more efficient in acquiring and administering our customers that will improve our margins that will improve the returns and contribute to our efforts to achieve return excess of our cost of capital and also to maximize the risk adjusted returns. So, all of this is based on financials, all of the projects, the internal rates of return well assessed by hurdles. So, it is achieving a market outcome that will allow us to deliver the financial results.
Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you. If I can ask just one other question, you guys priced sort of economic returns, you use your risk adjusted capital models, these conceptually make a lot of sense that aren\xe2\x80\x99t particularly transparent with all of us? Japan is a big deflationary market that\xe2\x80\x99s a big part of consumer. Are you guys like permanently going to be a drag on the overall P&C businesses as part of ROE it has in Japan or is this something you can overcome through niche strategies of realignment and everything else? Thank you.
Kevin Hogan
I am not going to be around very long if I am a drag.
Unidentified Company Speaker
So, ultimately, when you are looking at the targeted returns, it\xe2\x80\x99s a reflection of risk and return or in some aspects, some markets are lower risk. And so it\xe2\x80\x99s not purely a matter of what the return is, but what\xe2\x80\x99s the balance between the risk and the return? So, we believe we are fundamentally in that triangle between both risk and profit and I think Peter has been very clear with respect to his focus on that balance and at the same time on the objective of contributing to the long-term objectives that we have set.
Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank
Thank you. Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. I wanted to just say hats off looking at Slides 37 and 39 you have obviously made a lot of improvement here. 400 basis points, 500 basis points improvement over the last 3.5 years and that\xe2\x80\x99s not all weighted towards 2010/2011, really about 50% of that improvement has come since the end of 2012. Also we know anecdotally that company has made huge improvements in terms of re-underwriting the U.S. warranty book. And so that also benefits from, but if I go back to Slide 20, it looks as the last loss ratio for the business was about 58 on trailing 12 month basis ended 3Q 2012 and it\xe2\x80\x99s about 58 on a trailing 12-month basis ended 2Q 2014. If you made mass improvements in three very significant lines of business that comprise the consumer segment of AIG gets overall the loss ratio for the company hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really improved over a Q3 year period. For every step forward you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken the lines that you have improved, are there other lines of business where the loss ratio is deteriorating and that\xe2\x80\x99s complicating your improvement, why does it look that way?
Robert Noddin
So, I think there are those other lines of business that have had obvious deteriorations in loss ratio. There is a few slides here and there, nothing unusual. It\xe2\x80\x99s mostly a factor of product mix in terms of some of our products having a slightly higher natural loss ratio, lower expense components versus others, which have maybe a lower loss ratio higher expense component.
Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank
Okay.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse
It\xe2\x80\x99s Tom Gallagher, Credit Suisse. On Slide 40, AIG Fuji Life, which shows \xe2\x80\x93 from 2011 to 2103 a CAGR of something around 20%, 30% and that\xe2\x80\x99s at a time when the industry growth rates have started to stall. And I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s also in contrast for what happened to the property casualty side after the Fuji merger meaning you took rate to loss, you got sales momentum that went the other way. Can you give some color for what was driving the substantial growth here and also has that continued into 2014?
Jose Hernandez
(indiscernible) you probably going to put you on the slide, did you get that question?
Unidentified Company Speaker
Yes. I would like to talk in Japanese if it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Well, there are actually two reasons. One is that, that our product competitiveness has enhanced and this was accepted by our customers as Rob and Tim mentioned. That is one big reason.
And the other reason is that, we are seeing a big change in the Japanese customers\xe2\x80\x99 behavior in terms of purchase of insurance products. And looking at past, what happened most of the time was that customers purchased certain company\xe2\x80\x99s product from the exclusive agent to that company. However, over the past 2 to 3 years, we have seen a change in customers\xe2\x80\x99 behavior when they purchase insurance products, but now they are comparing additional products from 2 to 3 additional companies and then they compare the product purchased. And with that, we were able to achieve a big success in terms of partnership with insurance shops and life pro channels over the past 2 years. These are the big reasons behind this big growth. Did I answer your question?
Kevin Hogan
Yes. So as mentioned and as we saw on the Slide 41, most of the growth has come from distribution diversification and just even giving a very small portion of the sales in those particular channels, on a relative basis, has relative to just selling through the Fuji Fire agents mostly, has driven most of that particular growth. And so in terms of the future, you can just \xe2\x80\x93 you think about that those are additional types of things that what we could do with additional products, innovations like we have been doing or even potentially additional distribution channels could fuel growth, but that\xe2\x80\x99s been the pattern and the reason for the last three years.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse
Has that momentum carried into 2014 as well?
Jose Hernandez
First half of 2014, I think that, yes. The answer is yes.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse
And then just one last one, can you remind us the expected timing of the closing of the merger?
Jose Hernandez
Well, I think I have to refer back to the slide and Naomi\xe2\x80\x99s comment. I think right now, we are still working on the profit in terms of all the pre-merger activities that you detailed that have to go through. And at this point that\xe2\x80\x99s just still something that we are not going to be in a position to share at this time, but it\xe2\x80\x99s very complex. A lot of moving parts as Naomi was explaining and we are working hard just to make sure we get all those moving parts right.
Kevin Hogan
And I would just add to that, that all of that is obviously subject to regulatory approval. And so one of the aspects of this is we have an intimate engagement on a constant basis for them. So we were to tell you about the plan is right now. I probably couldn\xe2\x80\x99t execute it because they will be real happy that we\xe2\x80\x99re sharing that with you. So subject to their approval and when that happens which is a long going process, we will be very clear about that.
Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse
Okay.
Unidentified Analyst
(indiscernible) Scotia Capital. Just as a follow-up to John\xe2\x80\x99s question, maybe if you can\xe2\x80\x99t give us the timing on the closing of the merger, you have to give us and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be restricted on this, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask anyway. Timing of the realization of some of benefits associated with a $250 million spend, we know that then you\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend that, you have outline that for us, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t know when we can start to see the benefits. I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking for you to quantify what those benefits are going to be at this time, but when should we expect to start to see them?
Jose Hernandez
Well, look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be restricted in the way that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to answer that question. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that that we\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined the $250 million and we\xe2\x80\x99re about to spend will be. I would say that those benefits will come over time. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have huge expectations for those benefits to come early in the process. And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the way we have communicated around what the spend is over the next couple of years and what the benefit expectation. So, I will refer back to that.
Tim Schiltz
I would just add one to that and that is part of this process is about how we can make that as much of a known event as possible, so not a lot of the work that we are doing through distribution and the product alignment as reserve and how do we get more comfortable and then how we can begin to make some of those things happen before legal merger takes place. So co-registration of producers is clearly something that exists in the marketplace and it\xe2\x80\x99s a rare opportunity for us. As now we mentioned introducing a new sales tool that makes that in more straightforward and seamless process. It\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in our best interest, so our goal is to try to ensure that wherever possible and wherever permitted. We are making those steps before the legal aspect that this happens and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing \xe2\x80\x93 nothing inhibiting us from doing that, so that\xe2\x80\x99s actually a big part of what we are trying to achieve.
Kevin Hogan
So, I will try to bring that together and just to remind everybody, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s little bit obvious in the presentation, but when you are looking at our journey in Japan and what my colleagues presented today, when you are talking about three major components, you are talking about business as usual operations in Japan and Naomi talked about the fact that we need to keep our eye on the ball, continue to be competitive, continue to grow and drive the results in Japan. The second is the merger and the integration and we talked about the highly regulated and complex environment and we have to navigate through that process as we continue to do business as usual in Japan. And I would then think about overall transformations, but don\xe2\x80\x99t think about transformation or something that will start and it will be a big project that will start as we merge the entity. I think from what the message from my colleague was that we are looking for transformational-related activities and actions that happened as business as usual. I think Bob talks about simplification and consolidation before we moved into an IT environment.
And then looking at the merger as an ability to, when we have to pick and chose products, when we have to get product highlights, when we have to do all that pre-work that not only talks about, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of opportunity for us to be innovative and to transform in terms of anticipating what are the needs of the market. So, there will be transformation activities that will continue post that merger that will complement, but I just wanted to make sure that, that was clear that we are looking at the journey in Japan. We got to think about those three key components of that, because they will have an impact on obviously the results here in Japan and obviously as a result of the consumer business around the world in AIG. So, hopefully that helps a little. I think can you bring the mic up here, because our friends in the front \xe2\x80\x93 who has got the mic. Okay. There is one behind you, we will pass it forward.
Howard Gleicher - Aristotle Capital
Thank you. Howard Gleicher from Aristotle Capital. We have not talked about the management of your capital at all. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s most relevant maybe for your first to third sector products, but is that something that\xe2\x80\x99s handled by this group or somewhere else. And if it is can you talk about your strategies and changes in strategies? Is that an important part of what you do particularly for the first and third, second products? Thank you.
Jose Hernandez
So, I mean, obviously, we carefully manage the economics of the various products and we do balance between the profit growth and risk equation. So, what we choose to commit in terms of capital and the returns on that capital, we manage carefully product-by-product, portfolio-by-portfolio. Now, what the aggregate impact of that sort of capital is across the organization is something that\xe2\x80\x99s addressed through the global capital management process, which is really a separate process, where the risk adjusted return opportunities are high. The company considers capital fungible and will invest in those particular areas. Obviously, we try through the extent possible to be capital liquidity and tax efficient with respect to those strategies. So, part of that profitability growth and risk equation that we balance is that. So, we manage carefully the capital commitment, the returns on the capital at the product distribution level, but where the actual action to take place is more at the global capital and liquidity management level.
Unidentified Company Speaker
And remember that in creating the simplified legal entity structure here in Japan that started last year, all of that sits under a holding company here in Japan. So, instead of having a vertical view down individual operating companies in the past into Japan, there is now the ability to us to sit at a holding company level here and manage that across the global trend. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s intended for that very reason to create a little bit more greater flexibility here on the ground in terms of understanding what\xe2\x80\x99s happening, but then why isn\xe2\x80\x99t and what\xe2\x80\x99s the communicating with the head office. So as Kevin mentioned, yes, we are very actively involved in that. And as we look at that decision process around what to do with it and where to handle that, we were close to with New York and we look at across the whole spectrum of the businesses here in Japan.
Jose Hernandez
Would you mind passing the mic across? Thank you.
Scott Russell - Macquarie Securities
Good afternoon. Scott Russell, Macquarie Securities. I am interested in drilling into the local pricing environments, as the P&C market here and there is a clear observation that the concentration of the market should lend itself to favorable pricing environment, but perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s not that simple and one constraint that it creates to me is the local ratings bureau. So, I was just interested to understand what are the main constraints to lifting prices that\xe2\x80\x99s commoditization of product and then understand, specifically I was kind of thinking about how long this product, how much flexibility do you have to actually use the product in the eyes of local ratings bureau?
Jose Hernandez
We do follow the ratings bureau as you mentioned. There is a band around the filed rate that you actually do have some flexibility in terms of being able to set your pricing. And so we use that in terms of when we do come up with our segmentation strategy to be able to vary the rates around those that are filed in order to be able to price, when we see that we need to take rates in certain area or in a certain product type relative to the industry, we can actually do that and to the extent that we could be more competitive in certain areas, we can do that as well. So, there is some flexibility around the file rates that each company is allowed to have.
Unidentified Company Speaker
So, that market is largely tariff. So, those ranges are structured in the segment. So, the variation that you introduced to that is around highly combined coverages in that process, that\xe2\x80\x99s worked in Tim\xe2\x80\x99s factoring and the deviation components, for that you have some discounting and surcharge capability within that range, but the actual coverage themselves have tariff structures around. So it\xe2\x80\x99s more and how you combine them to deliver to the market, but that\xe2\x80\x99s also where some of the complexity has come in, right. People \xe2\x80\x93 traditionally when the market deregulated here and years ago there was this massive rush to flow writers and add-on coverages in that process, which added complexity to the process and complexity to the training components of highly educated distribution force, adding complexity to have a consumer viewed what am I buying. So, that was one of the underpinnings of the regulatory changes that took place here five years ago, and it comes back to you, what I mentioned before that there is flexibility and it\xe2\x80\x99s in and around how you componentize what you do, and how you really truly identify where you want to play. If you work hard at the cross broad marketplace then, yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get stuck into a very character and even commoditize conversation. If you focus on how you want to be very specific and whom you want to play with and how you want to play with them, so which distribution channel, et cetera, that\xe2\x80\x99s where the diversification and distribution, that\xe2\x80\x99s where the ability analytically to do that segmentation and that\xe2\x80\x99s where the componentization of what you bring to the market really has an offload value flexibility.
Scott Russell - Macquarie Securities
Yes. Thanks for clarity there. I guess my follow-up would be just it would be fair to say that across most lines of business you price near the ceiling?
Jose Hernandez
No.
Scott Russell - Macquarie Securities
What about the major piece, will they be similar to you, where would you categorize your pricing relative to the three majors?
Unidentified Company Speaker
Well, if you look at auto as an example, we had similar go-to-market strategies. Automobile business in Japan is not one product for us. American Home sales, individual automobile and single vehicle policies, you tend to be heavily in what we call corporate auto for the small corporate fleets. Fuji is very much in the commoditized individual space, right. So, even in that context, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably incorrect to review it as one product, one competitive scheme of things. When we moved forward before we had fully purchased the Fuji Fire organization, we took underwriting action and pricing actions in our AIU portfolio that was painful, 5 years ago, because it looked as what do we need to do to drive what we thought we are going to be in more competitive product suite. That\xe2\x80\x99s the same type of exercise that Fuji Fire then had to go through three years ago when we brought them into the fold, brought the analytics, but have been so successful in shaping that agenda for us in AIU and then having to work with educate and incent producers to begin behaving differently. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a top line driven discussion. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a \xe2\x80\x93 let\xe2\x80\x99s get the most premium for this. And it was around where is the most profitable segments for us to play whether that\xe2\x80\x99s fleet\xe2\x80\x99s size, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s in age of the driver, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s in the geography and how do we then incent that kind of behavior through our distribution channels.
Jose Hernandez
We have been sharing too many of our secretes, but I think I want to bring the whole conversation back about our focus group, growth initiatives about our data-driven analytic work, because we \xe2\x80\x93 the market might be structured and might be tariffed, but we believe that there are opportunities in understanding customer behaviors and where the opportunities are. I think we are very well positioned to maximize those opportunities.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi. (Indiscernible) Investment Group. What I was taking away from your slides on Japan Auto and Japan A&H was that there has been a lot of improvement in the margin so far. We feel comfortable kind of firming on the growth engine at these margin levels. And that it maybe worth risk adjusted returns if you want to be at now, but there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily a lot more underwriting improvement or underwriting actions to be implemented going forward? But then when I look at Slide 19 and I look at the auto side, you have two out of five underwriting actions still upcoming to be implemented and on the personal accident side, you have three out of four that are still upcoming to be implemented. So, is it fair to take away from that then that a lot of the benefit of those actions are going to be in other regions of the world outside of Japan? And if that is there, then secondly is it fair to then think that why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be fair to think that there will be some benefit from common systems and things like that, that would be sort of global that you would be implementing?
Unidentified Company Speaker
Okay. So I will deal with that one. These are not necessarily systems, maybe more processors. So, first of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that there is big hulking system out there associated with these initiatives. It\xe2\x80\x99s about the process and discipline that we have put behind the various areas. Some of them are much more relevant to advanced new research that we are doing in terms of the capacity pricing. But in the rating areas in the global rate, those are use of data not necessarily a system that\xe2\x80\x99s associated with those. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that they want more underwriting actions to take here in Japan, what we said is that we are comfortable at the levels that we are at, that we can balance between the opportunity to grow the business, and while we continue to do and actively managing portfolio. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a portfolio anywhere in the world that we\xe2\x80\x99re not actively managing. And as I mentioned before, that\xe2\x80\x99s not just portfolios that are running hot or warm, but rather the whole portfolio, there is always an opportunity to optimize. We have paid more attention to the larger portfolios. As I said, we took a risk of adjusting approach. So we\xe2\x80\x99re further down the track, perhaps in the deployment of some of these advanced techniques in the biggest portfolios in Japan and in the U.S. than other markets, but we\xe2\x80\x99re deploying those in those markets. But with respect to some of these global tools that we\xe2\x80\x99re developing that haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet been rolled out, Japan will benefit from those as will other areas.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And just on the returns, now that you are more comfortable with where those returns are on those two respective businesses. Can you give us some color and kind of what type of returns are you targeting on those?
Unidentified Company Speaker
So, I think what we said is we believe with the loss ratios our competitors and sustainable. We know that at the pre-merger stages our expenses are higher than ultimately where they will be. And, and so what the returns will be versus what they are is one of those balanced issues that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with and they trying on the team growth profitability and risk. And, and so, I think that we have the fact that in and also I mentioned the issues was on acquisition cost, for our direct marketing business which is the relevant part of our business, the economic margins right now are better than what the economy margins look like. And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a continued period of time before we see the normalization after the fact that we, that we are no longer before on the acquisition costs.
Jose Hernandez - President and Chief Executive Officer, Asia-Pacific
Okay. So, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any other hands. So, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I take this opportunity on behalf of Liz and the presenters and the management team to say thank you very much for today. Have a good evening.
