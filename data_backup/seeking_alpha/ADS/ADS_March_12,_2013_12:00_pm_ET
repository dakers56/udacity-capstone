Okay. So I think we\'re ready to begin. And our next presentation slot is Alliance Data Systems, and I\'m very, very pleased to have with us again this year, CEO, Ed Heffernan. And I think Ed is going to go through a presentation and leave some time for Q&A. Ed?
Edward J. Heffernan
Great. Thanks. I think what I\'d like to do is walk a little bit through the trends that we\'re seeing, and that I think will play out throughout this year specific to Alliance. And then I can get a bit more into the specifics of the model and why it works and where it works, and in general, again, my focus is more on 2014 and \'15, I guess, which is a good problem to have. But I know everyone also wants to know how this year is shaping up, so I\'ll probably spend a little bit of time on that as well.
I guess the takeaways, if you were to look at the trends that we\'re seeing for this year, how they\'re playing out and then versus expectations, I think being in March at this point, you get near the end of Q1, you probably should start having a sense of how the year is unfolding and in our case, for sure. I would say, there are probably half a dozen trends or themes that you can take away from this quick presentation and let\'s just go through the businesses and then we can step back and talk a little bit more about the macro trends that we\'re seeing.
So if you were to go through each of our businesses, I would say probably, of the 6 items, I would say 5 or probably 2/3 of them are incrementally better news and probably 1/3 of them are probably incremental -- incrementally worse news. So we\'ll put them all together, and I guess the net-net is, probably a bit better than anticipated at this point in the year. But if you were to start with the area where we had the most concern last year, which was our Epsilon group, despite the fact that they did sort of organic growth of plus 3% top and plus 10% on bottom, we had set the bar higher. And we believe that high single-digit organic top line growth or said another way, 3x the growth rate of GDP, seems to be where we want Epsilon to be.
We are comfortably tracking to our $1.3 billion top and $300 million on EBITDA. Those numbers look very solid. And our biggest concern from last year that I had throughout the year when we saw some of the organic growth drop off in the back half, we were hoping to ensure that this was merely a temporary air pocket as opposed to some ongoing weakness at Epsilon. And so in Q3, we had organic growth rate that actually turned negative, minus 3%. It bounced back nicely in Q4 to plus 3%. And happy to report, Q1 thus far, that organic growth rate is actually continuing to accelerate, and we want it to be actually in the mid-single digit or better by Q1 on top line and then go from there, and we\'re comfortably have made the turn.
So very good news on the Epsilon side. I would say also, if you were to turn to our Private Label business. Obviously, it\'s had a heck of a good run over the past year or so, and we\'re continuing to see incrementally good news or positive news coming out of Private Label, specifically from a credit quality perspective. I think that we had initially anticipated a slight drift up in losses this year because it has been running below normal. What we\'re finding after, as we head into our third month here, is that credit quality has not  budged. It\'s remained at historic lows, and we\'re not seeing pressure coming through, suggesting that they will be even a slight uptick in losses. So again, incrementally good news on that front.
Probably the most surprising thing would be on the actual growth side of the business. As you know, consumer revolving debt is -- hasn\'t really budged for the last year. And prior to that, continued to decline as consumers deleveraged, and that you\'re seeing it across the big general-purpose card players. In our case, we grow differently. We grow by signing new retailers and by increasing our share of wallet at the existing retailers, and that\'s what drove exceptional growth last year. The question was, can that happen again this year? The answer is yes. What we are seeing in the first quarter is we\'re seeing sales growth or use of our card up almost 30% versus last year. The portfolio itself is growing quite strongly and may probably do high-teens to 20% growth for the year. Again, versus an industry that probably won\'t grow at all. And then finally, what I focus on is, what\'s the outlook for \'14 and \'15? And that depends a lot on our ability to sign additional retailers. And what we\'re seeing is, while you haven\'t seen a lot of announcements thus far, you will, between now and when we release Q1. My guess is, you\'ll see anywhere between 3 and 4 announcements. We\'ve got incoming 4 significant deals. So the pipeline remains extremely robust. The goal for the Private Label business is to sign new business that will spool up to approximately $1 billion of incremental receivable growth, and they are probably about 2/3 of the way there at this point. So I think Epsilon is tracking very nicely on its turn from organic growth. I think Private Label is probably incrementally doing a little bit better.
Then we turn to Canada. I would say that\'s the only place we\'re seeing a little bit of softness. We were hoping that we would have mid-to-high single digit growth on the EBITDA side. Our goal is to make sure that we do hit those numbs, and I think we will. Where we are seeing some headwinds, however, is the FX rate. For those of you who track the Canadian dollar, you\'ll see that it\'s gone from par to about $0.97, so every $0.01 that we get dinged cost us between $2 million and $3 million of EBITDA. So it\'s somewhere around $7 million to $8 million of a hole that we need to plug from the FX side. So that\'s a bit of a headwind. And then on the issuance side, where we\'re issuing miles or points, that\'s when you go into Shell or something like that, and you get paid for filling up your gas tank. We like to run right around 5% issuance growth for the year. What we\'re seeing in Q1 is that is soft. Consumer sentiment, consumer spend in Canada at this point in the year is very soft. And so use of the Bank of Montreal and American Express cards that carry our logo have been off and promotional activity at some of the other sponsors have been off. So we need that to swing back into positive territory as we head into Q2, 3 and 4 to really nail down 2014 and \'15.
Turning to Brazil. That is continuing to ramp up very nicely. We moved from, again, no one released to almost 6 million by the end of last year. We are comfortably tracking to come in somewhere around 10 million Brazilians enrolled in our dotz program by the end of the year, which is interesting, because it took us 20 years to get Canada up to 10 million. So it\'s cooking along down there in Brazil. We expect the venture down there, despite the fact that we don\'t book revenue from it because we only own 37%, but the venture itself, we expect to do at least $100 million of top line, which is not a bad thing for a startup.
So I think those are probably the key trends I wanted to talk about. And then finally, cash and liquidity. The business itself will continue to toss off a lot of money. We expect to do $700 million-plus of pure free cash flow this year on EBITDA well north of $1 billion or so. I think it\'s like $1 billion, $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion, something like that on EBITDA, probably closer to $1.3 billion. And I think also from liquidity, we\'ve got about $1 billion in cash and another $1 billion or so of debt capacity that we\'ve wind up. So there\'s a couple of billion dollars sloshing around there, and we will look to put some or most of it to work either with moderate sized acquisitions or on the -- some type of buyback program. So that\'s pretty much the trends, I\'d say. If I were to net it out at this point in the year, I would say, no major surprises. I would say that Epsilon and Private Label are doing slightly better than we had hoped. I would think that the trend in the Canadian business is a little bit soft right now, and so we need to start watching that. That will be what I\'m watching now because that will drive \'14 and \'15, and I would say Brazil is looking a little bit stronger and continues to spool up and liquidity obviously is robust.
So again, lots of words. The end result of it is, we are tracking very nicely to our recently increased guidance that we had put out there when we announced Q4, and I don\'t see any major issues in the business for this year. And again, as we look into \'14 and \'15, we want to make sure that Private Label signs a few more clients. Again, you\'ll see the announcements coming out over the next 5 or 6 weeks, which are, there\'s some good names there, and we want to make sure Epsilon has continued to make that turn into sort of high-single digits organic top line, low-double digits EBITDA. And then Canada and Brazil, we want to make sure that Brazil stays on track and that Canada turns from sort of a soft first quarter and get that miles issuance up and running as well.
So I\'m just going to zip to sort of our guidance that we gave out there, which is, it\'s a company that essentially, organically, we tend to run somewhere around 3x GDP, which is pretty good numbs. So we\'d like to run around 8%, 9% pure organic growth. We\'ll tend to add a few more points from usually a modest sized acquisition that we\'ll put in there and then as you flow it through, you\'ll see double-digit growth in EBITDA, double-digit growth in free cash flow, double-digit growth in core earnings, and that\'s pretty much the story with Alliance.
I said I\'ve been there 15 years, and we\'ve been public for 12, so it\'s pretty much the same from us every year. You\'re going to have 3 engines. Usually, 2 of the 3 are really kicking it and one of them sort of a little bit soft, sometimes we have all 3 going, but at the end of the day, this year looks to be like many other years, where you\'re going to see very nice organic growth, and you\'re going to get some leverage down to your earnings. So again, I don\'t see any major issues with the company right now. The one quirky thing with us is, we have these convertible bonds out there that, as the price of the stock goes up, you actually get some dilution coming through on the share count. Some of it\'s real. Some of it\'s these phantom shares that I still haven\'t quite figured out how they work, but my fabulous CFO tells me they go away as soon as these things mature. And as you\'ll see as the price has gone from $60 to $90, to $130 to $155 or so, you\'re getting some of that into the denominator. That will hopefully end as the first one matures in August. And specifically, you\'ll see it flip-flop where, in the first quarter, we\'ve got a heck of a headwind with 67 million shares versus 63 million a year ago. By fourth quarter, it\'s going to be the complete reverse, and you\'re going to see earnings per share really start to zip. We\'ll have like 63 million shares versus 67 million last year, and that assumes we don\'t do any buyback.
So long story short or short story long, however you want to look at it, it looks to be a pretty good year. I would say, in general, I\'m pleased with 2 of the 3 businesses. I\'m very pleased with how Private Label is doing. I\'m very pleased with how Epsilon has made the turn. And I\'m pleased also with how Brazil is going, and I am a little bit concerned in terms of the softness that we\'re seeing in the Canadian economy and the FX rate up there, so we want to keep our eye on that. All of which, toss it all together, and it should be another very nice year for Alliance.
So that\'s about that. As you step back and think about the overall model and does it work and how does it work and everything else, there\'s no question that the model that we have been touting forever, I think, really seems to be coming home at this point in the sense of 3 separate platforms all catering to different types of industry verticals from discretionary spend, which would be more in the Private Label side to nondiscretionary spend, which would be more of the coalition model to everything in between, the ability to take transactional level information, sprinkle it with demographic and psychographic information to provide a very robust picture of the consumer and use that information to either acquire consumers, drive incremental sales, increase loyalty, whatever it may be. That\'s what we do. And the content side of the business is probably the first big piece, but we also do the delivery, whether it\'s from direct mail or point-of-sale to permission-based email, mobile, social or targeted display, it all flows through us as well.
At the end of the day, the marketing budgets, which can be $400 billion in North America, continue to shift away from general brand building and towards measurable ROI-based targeted marketing. That has been the trend that\'s been going on for the last 10 to 15 years. We believe that marketplace itself has an organic growth rate that\'s double the GDP. I always find it better to be in markets that are growing themselves. And so what we found is the dollars that are being allocated by the chief marketing officers at the Global 1000 continue to be funneled into this highly sophisticated micro-targeted marketing that we do at Alliance. And as a result, I think we\'re riding a trend that\'s going to go on for many, many years. And therefore, I think that we\'re going to be in pretty good shape as I look into \'14 and \'15. Right now, \'14 is beginning to shape up. I should know probably by about mid-summer whether \'14 is -- I don\'t want to ever say in the bag, but in a very good shape. I think right now, it looks like \'14 is in good shape, and we\'ll know by summertime whether we have all the clients signed that we need to get on board for \'14.
Further out than \'14, it gets a little bit dicier, but again, there\'s no major cliff that we\'re looking at right now. And I think really for the rest of this year, most of the trends look very, very positive. We\'ve got a couple that looks soft, and the net result is probably slightly incrementally positive from our last call.
So I\'m going to stop there, which will shock some people and see if we have questions.
Georgios Mihalos - Cr\xc3\xa9dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Great, thanks, Ed. Why don\'t I kick it off. Why don\'t we delve a little bit into Canada. Some of these trends that you\'ve seen, have they just sort of emerged more recently? You\'re predominantly nondiscretionary in terms of the spend there and in terms of how it\'s used?
Edward J. Heffernan
Yes. That was the question? Yes. We -- the Canadian business, it\'s basically, mom and dad driving the minivan, buying gas, groceries or pharmacy, liquor store, home improvement, but we also have a big chunk that is consumer spend on 2 of our sponsors, which is American Express and Bank of Montreal. They are card products, and so what we\'ve seen there is when you use the card, you get rewarded that some of that spending has been soft in the first quarter, which is consistent with what you\'re seeing about sentiment up in Canada, which is, things seem to have taken a bit of a pause versus the states here, where things actually continue to sort of chug ahead. So we want to make sure that we cover up that hole and the hole from FX as the year unfolds. So it\'s relatively recent.
Georgios Mihalos - Cr\xc3\xa9dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Is your sense, I think you spoke about mid-single digit miles growth, is your sense that you\'re tracking low-single digit or is it just kind of too early to tell as you think of?
Edward J. Heffernan
Yes, it\'s a little early because it\'s a huge chunk of the issuance up there is promotional-based. So if the big grocers or something, whenever they run the big promotions, you could go from negative issuance to plus 10%. So it\'s too early to tell. That\'s why we sort of give -- we look at it on an annual basis. Right now, what we are seeing is a little bit of weakness on the issuance in first quarter, the way the goofy accounting works up there, it shouldn\'t hit your numbs because a lot of it\'s deferred, but it\'s more a function of, as I look at \'14 and \'15, I want to make sure that metric bounces back as the year unfolds.
Georgios Mihalos - Cr\xc3\xa9dit Suisse AG, Research Division
And I assume one of the things you\'re going to be trying to do is roll out or have your sponsors roll out more promotional programs going forward as you\'ve done in the past, quite frankly?
Edward J. Heffernan
Yes.
Georgios Mihalos - Cr\xc3\xa9dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. Just as we think of that, the Canadian coalition-based loyalty program, is there a chance to bring a similar type program here in the U.S. or is it just radically different here?
Edward J. Heffernan
It\'s interesting. I get the question a lot and frankly, we haven\'t cracked the code yet. I\'ve had a swing and a miss probably 3 or 4 times over the last dozen years. We do know that Brazil is a great place to be right now. It\'s surpassing all our expectations in terms of how quickly it\'s spooling up and the interest on the sponsors, and it\'s weird because Canada is doing extremely -- we\'ve got 72% of the nation active in the program. Brazil is going to be 10 million folks by the end of the year and the few times we\'ve tried it in the states, we just can\'t, we can\'t get it to take off, and I think part of it is there\'s so much clutter here in the states where there\'s so many different programs that it\'s hard to get in there and have these huge sponsors shut down an existing program and allocate all their loyalty dollars to essentially a coalition program. So that\'s -- I\'m not saying it\'s not going to happen at some point, I\'m just saying that I\'ve had, I think 3 strikes or 4 strikes, and the good news, however, is all that clutter and other programs that are getting in the way, those are all Epsilon clients. So as far as I\'m concerned, I know the heads of the divisions want it in their P&L, but as far as I\'m concerned, single or coalition, I\'ll take either one.
Georgios Mihalos - Cr\xc3\xa9dit Suisse AG, Research Division
How do you think of the Private Label opportunity as we shift eventually into a more mobile world for payments?
Edward J. Heffernan
Sure. Again, it has -- the Private Label card itself, which is a loyalty platform, with very small balances, a lot of turnover, it\'s 90-plus percent of our 26 million folks are women. 25 to 50-ish type-year-old. They tend to have 2 of these Private Label cards of their favorite brand in their purse, along with, of course, the general purpose card. And general purpose can take 95% of the spending. That\'s fine with us as long as we get the little loyalty cards. What we\'re seeing with mobile is that, again from a Private Label card and how we make money in capturing SKU level information, that won\'t change at all. What mobile offers is an additional avenue to reach incrementally new customers. So for example, everyone talks about all this stuff going on in mobile. I can at least give some few concrete examples. If you walk into some of our clients that tend to cater or skew towards a younger demographic, what we\'ve been rolling out is people can actually apply for the card as they\'re shopping in the store, on their phone and what we found was, we did have a very nice lift in new account applications at those retailers, and that their first purchase was quite a bit higher than those who opened an account at the point-of-sale, which kind of all makes sense. So from a mobile perspective, it should help us drive incremental applications. Additionally, we did a pretty cool geo fencing gig over the holiday up in Columbus, where once you went through the so-called fence for folks who volunteered for the program, you would get a series of SMS, MMS-type messages saying, hey, it\'s so and so from your favorite retailer. I see you\'re in the mall, why don\'t you come on down and we\'ll give you an extra 10% off. So mobile is, what should help drive incremental volume in terms of new applicants, it\'s also ease-of-use, people can put all their cards on their phone, that should help, and the messaging from the geo fencing and everything else should help. But I got to tell you, I mean, it\'s going to be a while before it really kicks in. And so the more traditional paths that we utilize, we\'ll probably dominate for the next 5 years. And then we will have that capability on the mobile side. But let\'s be real here. It\'s not going to dent the needle, move the needle for a couple of years or so. But we\'re involved. We\'re in it, and I\'d say, net overall, it\'s a positive. But I don\'t share the enthusiasm that it\'s going to be this huge thing in the next 6 months. It\'s -- it will eventually creep in and we\'ll creep with it.
Georgios Mihalos - Cr\xc3\xa9dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Great. I think we\'ll have to leave it there, Ed. Thank you, so much.
Edward J. Heffernan
Thank you.
