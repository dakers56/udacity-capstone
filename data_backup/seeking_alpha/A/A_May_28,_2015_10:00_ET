So, I think I have just gotten the thumbs up to go ahead and kick off our Analyst Day. So, first of all, good morning and it\xe2\x80\x99s a real pleasure to be able to host you here today at New York Stock Exchange. I am delighted to have all of you here with us today. And I must say it\xe2\x80\x99s also wonderful to look out across the audience this morning to see so many familiar faces. I do want to say a few comments upfront. While I have had a chance to talk with you over the years as leader of the Chemical Analysis business, I am in a new role speaking to you for the first time as the CEO of new Agilent Technologies. But what I can tell you is my commitment to being transparent with you, to doing the best job I can, to provide the information that you need, remains there.
We are delighted to officially welcome you to the first Analyst and Investor Day of the new Agilent. There has been a lot of changes at Agilent. The new Agilent was formed a little over 6 months ago and a lot of changes, including myself. In fact, I mentioned to a few in the audience this morning that I believe today marks day 71 for me in the CEO seat. So, I am delighted to have the opportunity to be here in the East Coast and talk to you about the new Agilent. Who is the new Agilent? Where are we going? And most importantly, what are the actions that we are going to take to catalyze the creation of shareholder value?
Maybe one personal note before we start the formal presentation. When the Agilent Board of Directors asked me to become the third CEO in Agilent\xe2\x80\x99s history, naturally I was quite excited and actually thought they made a pretty wise decision. But I have to tell you I was even more excited by the opportunity to lead a new company, to create something new, to create a new Agilent. So, our goal today is to talk to you today about how we are making the new Agilent a reality. For your reading pleasure, our Safe Harbor statement, I am also told that I should note the fact that we will be making forward-looking statements, but to have no obligation to up those in the future. This will be the \xe2\x80\x93 this will not be hopefully the highpoint of today\xe2\x80\x99s session.
Let me talk to you about our time together today. It will be broken up into three parts. First, Didier and I are going to talk about the Agilent direction, the strategy, the financials, followed by Q&A. We are going to break for lunch. And after we come back from lunch, you are going to hear from the group presidents. They are going to take you through their strategies to win in the marketplace. This will be followed by Q&A. And then I will come back up here for the third part of our time together today, talk to you about how Agilent is thinking about future growth. And then we will close with just a few key takeaways from today\xe2\x80\x99s session.
The new Agilent, who are we? We are a $4 billion company, now 100% focused on the life sciences, applied chemical analysis markets and diagnostics marketplace, competing in a growing sizable market, $45 billion, highly profitable at 19%, but not at all satisfied with our status quo, not going to rest on laurels. We are going to drive for more. I also would tell you that we have the scale, the reach, the innovation team \xe2\x80\x93 innovation engine and an Agilent team allows us to not only compete, but win against anybody in this global marketplace.
I would like to take you inside the company for a minute and talk to you about what drives the Agilent team. We talk about this all the time within the company. We are helping our customers tackle some of the largest challenges of our generation from making the world a favorite place to live, from the food you eat, the water you drink, the air you breathe. To helping our customers develop new sources of resources to power the world\xe2\x80\x99s economy and to allow us to have our modern day standard of living and finding new ways to discover and treat diseases. This is highly motivational. Our employees are very proud of what Agilent does. They go home and talk to their family. They talk to their friends about what Agilent does. This is energizing for our team and I also think it drives shareholder value creation to have a highly energized team working for a higher purpose.
The new Agilent is launching its new strategy from a position of strength. As I mentioned earlier, we participate in a growing $45 billion marketplace. We have leadership in many aspects of these markets. We have reach that allows us to cover the greater than 265,000 labs globally. The composition of our revenue is now much different. The new Agilent is over 50% recurring revenue and I would expect that percentage to increase as we move the company forward over the next three years.
If you look at the mix of our business geographically and across end market segments, it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly well spread around the globe evenly geographically across multiple end markets. The message here for you, and if I think I recall this from my business school days, they call this diversification. So, this leads to a natural diversification of our end markets and stability in terms of our end markets that we participate in. This is a much different profile than the Agilent Technology that was presented a year ago or so in New York.
We have a seasoned executive team leading this new organization. This team is deep in industry expertise and market experience. I hand selected this team and as you might guess, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more pleased with the choices. But what you can\xe2\x80\x99t see is how we work together with inside the company. I think you will see evidence today as we present our plans for you, but this team is 100% committed to working as a team collectively, collaboratively to drive the company forward and to meet what we believe to be very ambitious goals that we have outlined for you today.
This team is moving quickly from Day 71 in my position and we are moving. We have already launched an Agile Agilent program. I am going to be sharing with you a series of Agilent terminology, but you are going to hear me talk in all my future speeches about Agile Agilent. It was referenced in the last earnings call, but this is our multiyear cost reduction and rationalization program already in flight, taking millions of dollars out of our cost structure and making us a more nimble and customer focused company. We have taken actions to rationalize our portfolio. We have successfully closed down and are closing down the NMR hardware business. And as you may recall, we have had a recent sale of our subscale, but very strong portfolio of sale of the XRD to Rigaku.
And then finally, I mentioned this in our last earnings call, but we have just completed the most expansive reorganization in our company\xe2\x80\x99s 15 years history. And I believe this restructuring has allowed us to position ourselves better for growth and margin improvements. And you saw some evidence on that in our Q2 call and I referenced via the top line order momentum we have with our new sales force.
Let me also talk to you about another aspect of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the company. Underpinning the results you have seen already is a cultural transformation within the company. Within the company, we call this One Agilent. And what do I mean by One Agilent? We are taking energies from the inside to the outside becoming much more externally focused. This allows us to do a better job for our customers and also make us more competitive. I talked earlier about the realignment and restructuring with the company. We are moving away from a complexity of silos and silo optimization behavior to driving for a total one company and believe in One Agilent. A message of collaboration, a message of doing what\xe2\x80\x99s right for the total company and external focus, that\xe2\x80\x99s the hallmarks of One Agilent.
We are also building on our heritage technology strength, our ability to come to market with great new products. We are now coupling in that with an application focus to better meet our customer application needs. This is a cultural transformation that the outside world can\xe2\x80\x99t see. But what I can tell you is as I travel around the world, as I talk to employees through coffee talks, webcasts, one-on-ones, the team is really responding to the message of Agilent. And the message for our investors, our owners is this will translate I believe ultimately into continued improved business results, because we will take the full power of this company, all the capabilities we have across our globe and put that into the marketplace to do a great job for our customers and beat back the competition.
So, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about our formula for premium shareholder value creation. First of all, what Agilent is trying to do, the new Agilent, has become increasingly in tune with our customers and our investors. Perhaps you know that Agilent launched it\xe2\x80\x99s first ever perception study. We used a third-party to independently talk to our investor base, to collect information on what you would like to see from Agilent, where you would like to see improvements, where you would like to see area of additional clarity, where you would like to see some changes. And we will talk later in my presentation today, but one of the things that came through loud and clear was, what is your capital allocation strategy. Also very clear, we want to see you do something in terms of a sustained and predicable approach to share repurchases. So, again, we are trying to be increasingly in tune to our customers and our investors as a new Agilent.
Okay. So, I have got this bold statement, catalyzing value through market leadership. What is this all about? This is really to impart you today that we want to move quickly, aggressively to have sustained, improved, predictable results. And here is how we are going to \xe2\x80\x93 here is our formula. We are first going to build, what we call, premium market positions. We will be very focused but we want to be number one in our chosen markets. And later on, you will hear from the group presidents on their plans to achieve these premier market positions in the analytical lab, the lab enterprise management marketplace that covers both the analytical lab and our diagnostics lab, and then you are going to hear us talk about how we are going to leverage the strength in our analytical lab to drive broader presence in the clinical lab. So, by establishing these premier market positions, this allows me to accelerate my growth, expand my operating margins, and generate cash so that I can optimize the capital allocation. You might want to think about this as three legs of a stool of premier shareholder valuation. And I am probably going to repeat it a number of times in my talk this morning, but it\xe2\x80\x99s about accelerating our organic growth, expanding our operating margins and optimizing our capital allocation. That\xe2\x80\x99s our formula. I think probably what you are most interested in understanding now is what is the how? So, what I would like to do is transition from background on new Agilent, the strength of our launching pad, what we believe to be the formula for shareholder value creation and now let me move into aspects of actually how are we going to make this happen?
So, I mentioned earlier the new Agilent is all about catalyzing value creation for our shareholders. These are the business goals. These are the targets that I have set for my team to communicate externally to you. Accelerate organic growth, 5% organic growth versus assumed market growth of 4% in the next 2 years, achievement of historic operating margins, up 400 basis points from where we are today, when you include the $40 million of the synergies that we are starting with after the company\xe2\x80\x99s split of the Keysight business.
And a new capital allocation policy, perhaps you have actually had a chance to read the press release this morning, where our Board of Directors has authorized me being in front of you today to talk about our new capital allocation policy, where we are going to return greater than 85% of free cash flow to our shareholders through an approach of sustained share repurchase through leverage buybacks and continuing cash dividends, 5% organic growth, historic high operating margin of 22% and 85% \xe2\x80\x93 greater than 85% free cash flow return to our shareholders. These are targets that I am communicating to you today.
Here is how we are going to do it, just a reminder of the launching pad that we are starting from. So, we have a very strong position in applied chemical analysis markets, number one in chemical energy, environment and food. We have a strong position in the life sciences markets and emerging position in the fast growing clinical research and diagnostics markets, very attractive market segments. Here is how we are going to go after the organic growth.
But let me first of all describe to you the strategy for the company. I mentioned earlier day 71 in the job for me today. One of the top priorities for myself and my new leadership team was to put together the overall company strategy and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we are going to share with you today. Our goal is to be the world\xe2\x80\x99s premier laboratory partner, number one in our chosen segments. And we are going to do that by creating these premier market positions. We are going to lead the analytical lab. We are going to win the battle in what we call lab enterprise management across all served laboratory markets. And we are going to advance the clinics in our chosen market segments again leading to accelerated organic growth, operating margin expansion and optimal capital allocation. And you can see underpinning that is our multi-year program, which we call Agile Agilent.
Now, for those who have an opportunity to read ahead, you may have noticed a little numbering sequence here, so that the presentation is quite easy to follow. I am going to step you through each one of the areas of accelerated growth, labeled A, and we will go into operating margin expansion, and finally close on optimal capital allocation.
What\xe2\x80\x99s our strategy to drive organic growth? It\xe2\x80\x99s a two-pronged strategy. The first prong is to drive the science and the economics of the lab. We are going to bring to our customers the most innovative solution focused on applications to help them best address their scientific needs in the laboratory, but our customers are also under tremendous pressure from an operational standpoint to lower their cost. So we are also going to address what we call the economics of the lab by providing second-to-none lab wide services, informatics, chemistries and consumables for all the equipment in lab, even if it happens not to be from Agilent. So, strategy, prong number one of the strategy is drive both the science and the economics of the lab.
The second prong of the strategy is to leverage our strength in the analytical market price to drive continued penetration in the connected clinical research and diagnostics market. And you will hear more later today in our conversation about what do we mean by that, but you can think about technology leverage from mass spectrometry to genomics to software platforms being driven into the diagnostics space. You can think about Agilent\xe2\x80\x99s engineering strength being able to develop next generation automation and sample handling equipment for the diagnostics lab. And you can think about the scale that we get by having a global large service organization to provide support for customers in the space.
So, the strategy here is a two-pronged strategy. One, drive the science and the economics of the lab; two, leverage our strength in the analytical marketplace to drive further penetration in clinical research and diagnostics. You are going to hear more from me to the group presidents, but part of my message today is also a message of focus. And what we are going to do in the applied chemical analysis markets, we are going to focus on certain market segments, we are going to bring to the routine and municipal labs, workflow solutions, allow them to not only help within the science, but drive down their operational costs. Our technology vectors to the investments in mass spectrometry, spectroscopy and chromatography. In life sciences, we will be bringing in multi-omics capabilities into pharma and life science research as well as our genomics, our workflow solutions. And you will hear later on from Jacob about how we are going to go after a focused strategy in diagnostics, focusing on cancer and winning that fighting cancer in the pathology lab and genetic disorders and advancing our business in advanced staining and next-gen sequencing. I think you have already seen by our actions in terms of portfolio rationalization that we will take strategies forward based on a focused message of if we believe we can win in a marketplace and differentiate ourselves, that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are going to invest. You are going to hear more from the team, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the message here about affluences through market focus and innovation.
The second leg of my value creation stool is all about expanding operating margins. And as I mentioned to you earlier, we have committed to reaching historic high operating margin of 22%. We believe they are very ambitious goals and it represents a 400 basis point improvement from where we are today. What I want to share with you this morning is this is already a strategy in action. We are moving forward. We have already taken action in two areas. We have restructured our operations. We have rationalized our portfolio. You may recall in our Q2 earnings call, I mentioned we have already had delivered $25 million of growth savings as a result of our efforts. We have programs underway to optimize our infrastructure.
What does that mean? It means, for example, I am going from the four ERP systems I have today to one to have all of my financials done on SAP, not on a mix environment of Oracle and SAP, all these system infrastructure optimization opportunities in front of us that we are moving on. It also means streamlining and optimizing real estate. So, there is number of programs underway to optimize our companywide infrastructure. You have seen other actions we have taken, such as closing down our U.S. government affairs office, so really looking our legacy business models as well.
The next I wanted to walk you through was streamlining R&D. So, what do I mean by that is we will grow R&D at a rate lower than our overall organic revenue growth? And the innovation core of Agilent is incredibly important to our ability to grow the top line and deliver on our operating margin improvements. But what this means is we are really looking throughout the company to say, are we putting our R&D money in the right places? In addition to streamlining, are we putting the money in the right places? And I think you have seen evidence already on our decisions with XRD and NMR that we will make the decision to reallocate at the same time streamlining R&D.
Now, in full disclosure, when we are preparing for this meeting yesterday, we have gone through the slides with the staff and they said to me, Mike, you are really a hard grader here. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t given yourself a check. Maybe at least you should give yourself a partial check, because we have done some massive changes, for example, in mass spectrometry, we completely reorganized how we handle the development for mass spectrometry going from three teams to one consolidated team under Patrick. We have made a radical change in terms of our Agilent research lab, having the organization and really having to stay focused in the life science and diagnostics space and eliminating the efforts in our core applied markets and really allowing the businesses to move forward. So, we have made some very big and bold moves already. But I am a hard grader and I want to continue to keep this out in front of us to really continue to challenge us to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re not only placing our bets in the right places, but they\xe2\x80\x99re also executing in a timely \xe2\x80\x93 go to market with our ideas.
We are also taking a different approach on the former Dako business, which as you know was acquired in 2012 in April. It\xe2\x80\x99s been operating more as a stand-alone entity within the company. Under Jacob Thaysen\xe2\x80\x99s leadership now we are taking a different strategy. We will integrate that pathology business and the other divisions that make up the former Dako company into Agilent. So, what does this mean? This means leveraging things, such as common commercial operation business centers, real estate I mentioned earlier ERP systems, so sort of the back office infrastructure activities of the company.
What this often end, you can also think about some of our corporate function where we have separate teams. What this really sets us up for is an ability to take cost out of the support of this business. And as you will hear later, Jacob has a very aggressive plan to improve the overall profitability of the Diagnostics and Genomics Group and this is a key aspect of that. These things don\xe2\x80\x99t happen overnight. They are underway. They are multiyear programs, but the message here is this is a different strategy than you have heard before relative to this particular acquisition. And we are going to continue to drive continuous supply chain cost improvements. Hendrik asked me earlier, he said, Mike, do I need to go to New York to present? I said, absolutely. They are going to want to hear what you have to say about continually to take cost out of our structure.
The third leg of the stool I\xe2\x80\x99d like to talk about is optimal capital allocation. One of the things that I heard loud and clear as I started to travel around and talk to investors and as we ran our perceptions study was, Mike, please describe what are your capital allocation principles, what are your priorities? And let me just step through those with you right now.
Our principles are we want to support the ongoing business. We will enable investments for growth. We want to deliver predictable and sustainable results to shareholders. I\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of paused for a dramatic statement there about predictable and sustainable. And we want to maintain our appropriate leverage, while utilizing the debt markets. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll see later on, I\xe2\x80\x99ll describe some of the details, we will use the debt markets for aspects of our share repurchases. We do not want to de-leverage the company with the same point, how I want to maintain our strong investment-grade rating.
What are the priorities? We want to maintain that strong balance sheet. When I think about value creation for the company, it\xe2\x80\x99s working both the income statement, which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about more, growth rate, operating margin, but also is utilizing the balance sheet in an appropriate way and we want to maintain that strong balance sheet strength. Investments, we want to spend money to support our internal investments and also to pursue tuck-in acquisitions. I think you saw a recent evidence of what I mean by tuck-in acquisitions with the recent announcement of the Cartagenia acquisition in Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s space. Capital returns, predicable and sustainable. In rating, we want to uphold our investment grade ratings.
So, let me just talk to you about the specifics and again, you may have seen some of this already in an earlier press announcement, but we are committing to increasing cash returns to our shareholders. Over the next 3 years, we will return $1.7 billion to our shareholders through sustained repurchases of outstanding shares, moving away from the prior strategy of being anti-dilutive. So, you could probably expect 4%, 5% cumulative share reduction by the end of 3 years. We talked previously about a 45% return of free cash flow to shareholders. We are now taking that up to 86% of our free cash flow we return to shareholders. And our strategy will result in a change in our debt ratios as well. We\xe2\x80\x99re targeting adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of 2.3. Didier will go through some of the more details later on his presentation, but I just wanted to share with you the headlines from this new approach.
I wanted to set up the presentations that you are going to hear later on from the group presidents. You are going to hear Patrick talk about how we are going to lead in the analytical lab. You are going to hear Mark talk about his ACG strategy of winning what we call the lab enterprise management battle, the lab-wide services, informatics battle across all of the laboratory space that we serve. And then Jacob will talk about advancing in the clinic. What I am also trying to impart is that we have one company strategy with clear alignment throughout the business units. We are all working as One Agilent to achieve what we consider to be our key measures of success of expanding our presence in pharma, in academia and government, grow our share in LC/MS, excuse me, expand our informatics footprint by expanding OpenLAB win with our CrossLab services, regain pathology leadership and have a bigger play in the clinical next-gen sequencing adoption and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear more about that from the group presidents, but again, takeaway here is one company strategy, aligned by group, working as one leadership team to deliver on what we believe to be very ambitious goals for the company.
So before we move on to Didier, I\xe2\x80\x99d just like to close here and summarize how we are going to win, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve described this to you earlier, but not in the same format. We are taking a phased approach. And this is a multiyear plan to deliver on those commitments we made earlier. I have described to you earlier that 2015 is a year of transition. So you might want think of Phase 1 2015, year of transition, new company forum, digesting dissynergies and taking action in a number of areas where you\xe2\x80\x99re laying the foundation for future margin expansion and growth. So, we restructured our operations. We talked earlier about streamlining the R&D. We have taken action on SG&A. So, we are in Phase 1 transition. When I am in front of you next year, we are going to be talking about Phase 2, what we have accomplished in the leverage phase that the foundation that we have established, the program initiative we started in 2015 are paying off in driving the improvements we had projected. Then you can think of Phase 3, year 3, we are leading. We are now in these premier leadership market positions that I talked about earlier. And again, the Agile Agilent program is the underpinning, making us some more nimble, lean and customer-focused company.
What you are going to hear from each of the group presidents are how they are going to grow share in the lab business, analytical lab business. You will hear Mark talk about how he\xe2\x80\x99s going to leverage the installed base and then you are going to hear Jacob talk about how we are going to win in our selected domains in the clinic. And you can see the commitments we are making here in terms of margin expansion over the next 3 years.
So, with that, I will turn it over to Didier.
Didier Hirsch
Thank you, Mike and good morning everybody. So, the focus of my presentation will obviously be on how the new Agilent will continue growing the value we create and also how it will increase the percentage of the value created in terms of value distribution. And it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 the key words there are clearly and Mike has already pointed it out, it\xe2\x80\x99s predictable, it\xe2\x80\x99s sustainable, it\xe2\x80\x99s responsible, it\xe2\x80\x99s disciplined, it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent, this is the new Agilent.
So, here is the recap of our commitments. Number one, increasing our operating margins from 18% adjusted for the cost dissynergies to 22% in 2017. And by the way, 2017 as you know is just 1.5 years from now. So, we are talking about a really short-term commitment. We are \xe2\x80\x93 and what is different from perhaps what we have shown you last year is the way we are going to achieve that. There is less dependency on operating leverage, on the top line growth and we have taken more actions to de-risk that plan by really addressing the cost and operating expense opportunities. So, we will talk more about that.
The second commitment is around value that we are distributing and that\xe2\x80\x99s 85% or slightly over 85% of our free cash flow. And again, that\xe2\x80\x99s very different from what we have committed to last year. And the way we are going to achieve that is by leveraging the balance sheet to the tune of $250 million per annum, so that we had committed in the past to buyback $130 million per year, which was basically anti-dilutive. Now, we are talking about $380 million. So, for those of you who are wondering how come in our press release, we have a very strange and very specific, very, very precise number, it\xe2\x80\x99s $380 million times 3, which the board has approved as a buyback over the next three years. On top of the $365 million, by the way, that we have committed too to do this year and that we will achieve by the end of October. So, a different increase in the value distributed and increase through debt financing.
Now, how does our commitment compare to what we have achieved in the last 3 years? Our commitment for the next 3 years, starting in 2014, how did it compare to what we have achieved at 2014? In terms of core revenue growth, we achieved 4.6% in the last 3 years over market growth, but we believe that we can expand even on the market share leadership and increased our revenue growth to 5.5%, partly through addressing some of the operational issues that we have pretty clear about in the past and partly probably through a market that seems to be handing along fairly well on the basis for the next three years.
And in terms of operating margin, again this is not a new commitment. We have already expanded our operating margin by 2.2 percentage points in the last two years, but we are accelerating our committed growth. On an adjusted basis again adjusting for the $40 million of cost dissynergies, which was about 1 percentage point of revenue, we are really committing to a 4 percentage point \xe2\x80\x93 410 percentage points improvement over 3 years and with LSAG and ACG, our analytical labs segments, our two segments addressing the analytical labs, reaching 23% and DGG reaching 20% from 14% in 2014, so 6 points improvement for DGG, but also a 4 point improvement for analytical labs. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s a significant improvement. And the reason for the acceleration is basically a slightly higher operating leverage, but mostly \xe2\x80\x93 versus the history, than mostly all the agile Agilent actions that Mike and team have initiated in the last few months. And as far as DGG is concerned, 20% and you will see that later when I talk about the benchmark. We don\xe2\x80\x99t see that clearly at the end and we have a commitment from Jacob, who will talk more about it during his presentation to go beyond 20% beyond 2017.
Now, in terms of how does our commitment compare to what we said last year at the March Analyst Meeting, its two points to note. Number one, I have already made that point that if you look at our revenue, expected revenue growth rate in \xe2\x80\x9816/17, 5% per annum, that is 1 point below what we needed last year, what we said we needed last year in our model to achieve 22%. So, it is \xe2\x80\x93 we are de-risking achieving the 22% by taking actions on topics where we can control. And then the second thing is that the \xe2\x80\x93 from a \xe2\x80\x93 in terms of the yearly pattern of the improvement, as you can see, it\xe2\x80\x99s a regular improvement from 2014 to 2017.
The next two slides that I will present, I believe key slides and a very important topic of discussions both internally and externally, it\xe2\x80\x99s about benchmarking. And there are obviously a lot and lot of viewpoints about who should we be benchmarked against. And we have heard a lot of viewpoints. Our view at Agilent is you cannot take the whole of Agilent, LSAG and ACG and DGG and compare it to a single basket of company and even less \xe2\x80\x93 more, I mean, even less to one company, which also has been offered. And what we think we have to do is take our analytical labs business and benchmark them against their competitors and take our DGG business and benchmark DGG against a separate peer group.
And let me go first through the benchmarking of our analytical labs business, LSAG and ACG and how we view our peer group and our main competitor in this field. On the left, first, I will focus on the left, you have our main competitors. And mostly, they are very focused on the analytical labs, I would say, except for Danaher Life Science and Diagnostics where we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the granularity. So, basically, we took the whole segment, but clearly, they cover a lot more than just the piece that we compete against mostly in the aspects. They also cover the Beckman Coulter and the Leica, which where we don\xe2\x80\x99t compete in terms of LSAG and ACG. Obviously, we compete with Leica in DGG, but everybody else is very focused on the same markets, Waters, obviously, Thermo analytical instruments, Shimadzu analytical instruments, PerkinElmer Environmental Health and Bruker.
And first thing that you will note, obviously, is that Waters is way ahead of the pack, I would say, at 28% operating margin non-GAAP based on last year\xe2\x80\x99s results. And we are ahead of all the other competitors. And one of the discussions, which is a very fair discussion is why do you compare yourself to a Japanese company and they are really not interested in making money. They are only interested in kind of bringing and making their short-term kind of focus. Well, we do believe that the company we compete with and on a lot of topics and on and on and on. I mean, so basically, what we have \xe2\x80\x93 the way we have assessed this peer group and trying to really \xe2\x80\x93 we could either compare ourselves to the average and we compare favorably to the average obviously, but we could also compare ourselves to Waters or Thermo, who are the clearest competitors in our field. Problem with Waters is that we compete with them mostly in the pharma market and on two product lines, LC and LC/MS and obviously associated informatics and consumables and services. And the overlay with Waters is about 45% of those two segments. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a bit challenging for us to compare us to Waters and only Waters.
Now, Thermo analytical instruments is a company that is a segment of Thermo that is about the same size as we are and you can see to the right, the size of Thermo at $3.3 billion versus our $3.4 billion in the analytical labs. But the overlay is double what the overlay is with Waters, 90%. It\xe2\x80\x99s a huge overlay. Basically, the overlay covers everything we do, pretty much. All of the chromatography and all the spectrometry and all the spectroscopy and it is a very, very \xe2\x80\x93 and obviously, all the other services. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just pharma it\xe2\x80\x99s pharma and applied markets. And that is why the overlay is so big. And we felt that it was responsible enough just to say, okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s benchmark ourselves, either against the average and internally, obviously, we do a lot of benchmark with Waters. But really on the apple-to-apples and not comparing the whole of Agilent just to Waters, let\xe2\x80\x99s benchmark ourselves against the average. Let\xe2\x80\x99s benchmark our LC business against Waters and LC/MS, but the whole of Agilent in analytical labs, let\xe2\x80\x99s benchmark it against Thermo. And what we see is that we have about 2 points operating margin \xe2\x80\x93 we have 2 points higher in operating margin. We spend about the same amount in R&D. And when you look at what we have done with this R&D in the last three years, our business \xe2\x80\x93 those two businesses have grown 5% on the core basis, which is 2 points better than Thermo. So, we are doing good things with the R&D we are spending. And on top of that, the R&D has no impact on the operating margin and our operating margin is better than Thermo.
DGG, now DGG is \xe2\x80\x93 we struggle a little bit more about benchmarking DGG. We would love to benchmark DGG against Ventana, against Leica, against pieces of Illumina, but there is no way we can do that, because the information is not available. So, what we felt was we should benchmark it against companies that basically operate in the same markets and have about the same business model. And we have listed those companies here. And what is obvious and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I am not going to spend much time on this is, is that our operating margin is way under where it needs to be. Hence, the commitment from Jacob to grow the operating margin within you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to basically the 20%, which is above the average of the companies that operate in the same kind of markets and run about the same kind of the same business model. But the R&D is very similar to the R&D of those companies. So, R&D spend, especially considering the growth opportunities that we are going after and that Jacob will develop, our R&D spend seems in line. Our operating margin really is way under where we need to be, and we will grow the operating margin by 6 points by 2017. And certainly, do not \xe2\x80\x93 we will not stop there.
Now, the next two slides, so this slide is about \xe2\x80\x93 I mean, this slide is about the roadmap to the operating margin. And it\xe2\x80\x99s also a question about how we do we grow from the 19%, which is the reported non-GAAP operating margin in 2014, to 22%. Well, the first one is clearly operating leverage, which is about 60%. When you put into the revenue all the impact of currency, of volume and mix and pricing and obviously, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bigger bottom of exercise to get to that number, therefore, hence the precision of the $263 million and so $263 million coming from operating leverage. The next two lines refer to the $160 million that Mike presented in one of his slides, basically, are the cost-reduction programs. I\xe2\x80\x99ve separated the impact of the exiting the animal business and also selling the XRD business, which has a negative impact on revenue of $80 million versus the 2014 number but has a positive impact on operating profit of $20 million, you know those numbers.
The second line is about other cost reduction programs. There is a $75 million that Mike has already highlighted and Henrik will cover in great detail. There is a $55 million coming from the Agile Agilent program, and Mike gave a lot of examples of what we are doing there. And there is $10 million that basically results from the fact that we will obviously spend more in addressing the \xe2\x80\x93 in making sure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more FDA regulatory issues in the future and addressing our compliance when it\xe2\x80\x99s completed, but less than what we have spent in the course \xe2\x80\x93 over the course of the last two years to address the FDA issues and address it very, very positively obviously, as you know. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s $10 million for that portion.
The next line is about the Agilent Variable Pay program. All our employees receive an incentive to achieve higher operating margin. For every additional point of operating margin, they get \xe2\x80\x93 we distribute to employees under various forms, 1 additional point of compensation. And as you can see that we are planning on increasing the operating margin by 3 points, that\xe2\x80\x99s 3 percentage points of incremental compensation that will be distributed to the employees as an incentive or reward for getting us to the 22%. By the way, the bonus target is 10% when we achieve 24%. So employees are certainly looking forward to going even beyond the 22% because that\xe2\x80\x99s the target bonus of 10% of pay.
Next line, you have already \xe2\x80\x93 we have already covered it a lot, split dissynergies, $40 million. That number hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed. That\xe2\x80\x99s the cost that we\xe2\x80\x99re incurring after the separation from a key site. And then inflation, big number, what we have assumes in our model, and if it\xe2\x80\x99s less, it\xe2\x80\x99s less and then I will take it down to the bottom line, but we have assumed this 3.5% compensation increase every year for the next three years, 3.5% of our base pay of about $850 million, plus increases in pension expense, in healthcare costs and payroll taxes, etcetera. So, this is mostly people kind of related. And so the math, you add up everything to $971 million and 22% operating margin.
Now, the split in the operating margin improvements between gross margins and operating expense and that\xe2\x80\x99s something we are \xe2\x80\x93 we were very keen on modifying that mix versus what we had based our model on in the past \xe2\x80\x93 in the last year. Basically, this 410 basis points operating margin improvement after adjusting for the separation, for the cost of the separation and the 410 is pretty much equally split between gross margin improvement, which comes from both operating leverage and the $75 million of cost reduction that Henrik is working on. And then the rest coming from operating expense reduction and that\xe2\x80\x99s mostly the Agile Agilent program. And again, it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly regular increase over the period.
Last topic is about capital structure and capital deployment. So, one thing isn\xe2\x80\x99t changed is last year we committed to distributing about 15% \xe2\x80\x93 14%, 15% of our free cash flow of generating \xe2\x80\x93 excuse me, 14%, 15% of revenue as free cash flow and the number is the same and that excludes obviously any one-time expense, like for example, the cash outlays we incurred because of the separation with Keysight and in a restructuring program, so about 14%, 15%. What is very different of the capital return? We had talked about distributing 45%, basically, because there was no leverage. It was basically distributing 45% out of the cash. We were able to generate in the U.S. and the cash that we are able to just repatriate from offshore.
We have decided to leverage the company to the tune of $250 million additional debt financing every year and this $250 million is therefore added entirely to the number we have committed to last year. So, last year, we said $130 million of buyback, which would have been pretty much just anti-dilutive. And now, we are saying $380 million again on top of the $365 million, which we committed to at the beginning of this fiscal year and that we will complete at the end of the year. So, that makes capital returns above 85% and obviously has an impact of our debt. And that debt level \xe2\x80\x93 the debt without any additional debt to finance any bolt-on U.S. acquisitions, obviously, if we do bolt-on offshore acquisitions, we have plenty of cash and embarrassment of ridges. But if we do U.S. bolt-on, they will be financed through debt. And here is the debt level and the adjusted debt to EBITDA, again, without any acquisition, all of our numbers exclude any potential bolt-on acquisitions in the coming years of 2.2 to 2.3, which is both obviously in line with our investment grade, strong investment grade rating and also very much in line with most of our peers.
With that, we are going to move now to the Q&A session with Mike. And I guess wait until you are given the microphone to give us your name, company and I will \xe2\x80\x93 you go ahead. Everybody will get a chance. And hopefully, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to repeat the answer. Yes, the question, sorry.
Q - Jack Meehan
Yes, thank you. This is Jack Meehan from Barclays. Just wanted to ask about the path to 22%, a good portion of that is organic growth. Can you talk about the sustainability and the predictability of revenue growth? What are some of the uncertainties that you see in the business model and how do you weigh the macro factors within that?
Mike McMullen
Yes, Jack thanks for the question. I will start and Didier if you want to jump in as well. But as Didier outlined to you, the path to 22% is about 60% top line and 40% through bottom line cost reductions. And I really wanted to change the profile of how to get to 22%. So last year, you may have seen more emphasis on a higher level of growth and also more coming from gross margins. I really wanted to change the mix to really, if you will, de-risk our path to 22%. So, that was kind of the theme overall and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have spent a lot of time to you today showing the bridge to actually how we would get there, so that \xe2\x80\x93 you said there is something really behind it and kind of take a look at it, we are very transparent in our assumptions.
Now, getting to your question in terms of the organic growth, I think the \xe2\x80\x93 what you are going to hear today is in terms of the recurring revenue piece, that\xe2\x80\x99s a nice predictable piece of our business, a growing part of business. We hear Mark talk about the ACG strategy. I think I probably don\xe2\x80\x99t have any \xe2\x80\x93 lot of new novel insights here, but I think for \xe2\x80\x93 I think Agilent, along with the rest of the industry, is really dependent on the continuing improving in China. And you can hear Patrick talk a bit about China. I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it at all in my remarks, but they have been such a driver of growth for the overall industry. There is a down year. My view is the markets have been recovering gradually and that will be a source of strength. So, if I miscalculate in China that would probably be, for me the biggest risk that I see going through the plan. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I miscalculated, but Didier, anything else that you would...
Didier Hirsch
I think we have been very responsible in modeling the operating margin improvement with 5% organic growth. I mean, the world GDP will probably grow over 3% and our market is about 4% and we can grow 1 percentage point of overall market. We do have a plan in case we exceed that number to return the incremental profits to the bottom line, but we also do have a plan in case the world economy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pan out exactly as we expect to see, try to achieve under reasonable limits obviously that achieve the 22%.
Mike McMullen
Yes. And I just had a thing, Didier, we really didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk a lot about our background GDP assumptions in our forecast, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a solid, but...
Didier Hirsch
Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly below the pundits. I mean, we have been burnt many times. So, in the past, I was just taking exactly the pundits, the numbers from the pundits. This time, it becomes....
Mike McMullen
We came up with our own forecast, so\xe2\x80\xa6
Dane Leone
Hi, this is Dane from BTIG. Thanks. Thank you for the nice start to the presentation here. So, as we think about the clear theme of returning capital to shareholders, an 86%, 85% of payout, what \xe2\x80\x93 maybe more on the why you want to pursue that strategy? Agilent is still maybe a mid, slightly larger mid-cap company. Larger deals do make a difference to the organization. You have three verticals. Two of them, you are definitely a strong market leader on the DGG side and that\xe2\x80\x99s probably undersized compared to some other companies that you put out there. Valuations in the market are high. Interest rates are very low. We have seen transformational deals get rewarded in the market. Why not be more aggressive in terms of deploying capital? Is there hesitancy from what you saw with Dako or just generally, I guess, yes, any color in terms of why?
Mike McMullen
Yes, no. Thanks, Dane. Great, great, question. Obviously, this is a topic we talk to great lengths with our board and with Didier. My view on this is the following, which is a very clear message from our investors that are looking for sustained return of capital. But what you also see, we still have borrowing capacity if need be to do what may considered to be tuck-in acquisitions to really augment our growing businesses. I was just trying to be very realistic about where we are as Agilent today. As I mentioned earlier, we have got a lot of moving pieces. There is of lot of things really moving within the company. 2015 is a major year of transition. We have to build a strong, strong foundation. And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also fair to say that the commitments made by the previous leadership team and Dako were not there yet. And I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear a story today, a really credible story, a really credible path forward about how we\xe2\x80\x99re changing that scenario and how we are getting a trajectory of growth, et cetera. So, I think this really was the prudent course, which was to return cash to shareholders, use our balance sheet but also maintain capacity to do tuck-in acquisitions as we move forward. As Didier mentioned, we still have overseas cash as well. I am sure that will be a point of topic. But if you really sit back on where we are as a company, I really try to share with you, there has been a lot of changes within the company, and we want to make sure that we are stable, we got the foundation build, we got the trajectory going before we move another direction.
Didier Hirsch
Yes. The other thing I would say is that Agilent has always been a very shareholder-friendly company. We distributed over $10 billion in the last 10 years, so that\xe2\x80\x99s $1 billion per year. But we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get much credit because it was not disciplined, it was not consistent, it was not predictable. And we learned. And we decided that we will retain this shareholder-friendly approach. We can afford it. In fact, the new Agilent can afford it much more than the old one because it\xe2\x80\x99s much more stable and predicable. And therefore, we will do it in a way that is much more consistent and sustainable and predictable.
Derik De Bruin
Hi, Derik De Bruin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. So, one strategic question and then a general one. So, you are number five in the academic and government markets by your record. I mean, a lot of that is reagents, kits and stuff. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have a very strong presence there, it\xe2\x80\x99s like \xe2\x80\x93 can you talk a little bit more about how you actually see your growth in that market going? How do you get to number two, number one sort of position in your mind?
Mike McMullen
Yes, absolutely. Great question, Derik. Thanks for that. And Patrick, I will try not to steal too much of your thunder, because I know you are going to address this later on, but maybe just a few headlines. First of all, we are driving to be within the top three players in this space. And we think there is broader place for us in \xe2\x80\x93 particularly in mass spectrometry. We have some really great ideas in terms of our mass spectrometry play. We also have new products that are coming out in terms of genomics and genomics workflow. So, where we play in genomics, our products have been quite successful. The challenge we have had, I think historically is really getting the channel reach right and it\xe2\x80\x99s a different sales process. It\xe2\x80\x99s a longer buying cycle. And traditionally, most of our team has been focused more in the private commercial side of the business.
So, it\xe2\x80\x99s a different sales process. We have also have been working for a few years on academic collaborations, and those we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see pan out in terms of leading academics through our thought leader program being advocates for their research on Agilent\xe2\x80\x99s equipment. So, under Darlene Solomon, for example, we have an academia thought leader program. So, we are very active. And we are still working on the market development side. So, I guess I would summarize, Derik, to say I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been a combination of three things. One is continuing expansion of the portfolio, which Patrick will talk about, really getting the channel reach right, particularly in countries such as China, where so much of the market is \xe2\x80\x93 the academia market in China has a huge impact on the overall business. And then the third thing is really \xe2\x80\x93 we have been placing a lot of bets in terms of market development programs, really starting to see they will start to materialize in terms of commercial sales.
Ross Muken
Good morning.
Mike McMullen
Hey, Ross.
Ross Muken
Hey. As we think about the sort of new Agilent and trying to reinvent the business and get the new algorithmic operating model down, today\xe2\x80\x99s stock is down about 200 basis points worse than the market. So, market is not necessarily hearing the message. The stock has underperformed on a 1, 3 in line on a 5-year basis. I mean, what are people not understanding, because I think when you look at sort of what\xe2\x80\x99s been outlined today, there is a lot of change and there is a lot of momentum and there is a lot new, but it\xe2\x80\x99s still not translating from an investor perspective into maybe the market appreciating where you are trying to take it. So, when you did that whole investor perception study and got a lot of the feedback, you obviously learned a lot. How do you feel like you translated that? What are people not hearing when you thought about the value creation that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to come from this plan to reverse some of those years of maybe underperformance versus the market? Where are we not kind of getting the message correct?
Mike McMullen
Yes, thanks, Ross. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to first of all imply that you are not getting the message, but thanks for the great question. And one thing I have learned already, you have only been on the job 71 days, is not to overreact to daily movements in stock. But what I hope the message is coming through is, one is that we have a real credible path to improve our operating performance. That is not simply aspirational. That there really is a credible path, a clear roadmap to move our company\xe2\x80\x99s operating margins up 400 basis points to have this organic growth profile that I spoke about. And also that they really understand the \xe2\x80\x93 how we are planning on using our cash. As Didier mentioned, the new Agilent is a much more stable in terms of incoming revenue and I am not sure that message is fully out there perhaps that the mix of businesses is dramatically different. And we are 51% right now recurring revenue. That percentage is only going to increase as we do things in the ACG business, as our Dako and other aspects of the DGG business grow.
So, I think I really want to make sure that, that message is clearly understood that the path is forward, because one of the things that came through loud and clear in the perception study was, as Didier mentioned earlier, we don\xe2\x80\x99t always know what to expect from Agilent. We hear one strategy then we see another action, we can\xe2\x80\x99t link the two. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I went out of my way today to talk about sustained, improved and predictable results, because we want to do what we say. And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the message I am hoping will start to come through today that this is our plan, this is what we are planning on doing and what we will step through and execute on that plan. And I think that was a clear piece of feedback on the perception study, which was relative to capital allocation. We are not sure what you are doing and what is your strategy going forward. And \xe2\x80\x93 so I think we are really trying to today make sure that our forward-looking plan is fully understood. We are trying to be very transparent on all the details, so you can see what we are trying to do. Is there anything else that you recall?
Didier Hirsch
No, I would just \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s tough obviously for us to be measured in terms of TSR. I am going back before the split, because really I mean that was a different world versus today. Today, I think everyone agrees our valuation is solid compared to our peer group. And so there are things that the investors do get, I mean \xe2\x80\x93 and it used to be there were rumors of acquisition, I think those are coming away. And so it\xe2\x80\x99s really based on the true expectations that Agilent will increase its operating margins. We will have a more predictable and sustainable capital return strategy. So, I think more and more, we are getting more and more aligned, but it is true that for us that the last few years have been tough and we had a tough time communicating the message. And it\xe2\x80\x99s tough on us now to be measured on those old days, because it is different.
Ross Muken
You are confident that when you look at this with the board, this is going to lead to top-tier TSR?
Didier Hirsch
That\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely the goal.
Mike McMullen
Really, absolutely.
Tycho Peterson
Hey, Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan. Maybe just to kind of follow-up on that line of thought, I think one of the things people had maybe even hoping the other day was that 22% operating margin is the first step, but there is a lot of room to go. Do you see any reason as you look further out that this couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a mid 20s operating margin business, which would be in line to what Thermo has guided to and what Mettler would do in a normal environment?
Mike McMullen
Yes, Tycho, a great question. So, when I think about the operating margin goal to establish ourselves. So, first of all, 4 points of improvement in a highly competitive marketplace is not a slam dunk. These are very ambitious goals. And I think one of our competitors was here in this same \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps in the same room talking about their large R&D spend and all things they were going to do to capture share in the market, but it\xe2\x80\x99s very competitive marketplace. That will be the first comment. The second piece would be is we feel like \xe2\x80\x93 I felt like we needed to take a different path to get there, which is I thought the path there was too top line driven and too much on the gross margin side. Now, I am expecting more from him internally, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to de-risk our profile to give me some upside. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there is a natural upside where we can take this beyond \xe2\x80\x93 I mean, don\xe2\x80\x99t assume there is a ceiling at 22%, but I need to get to 22% first before we can start talking about something even more. If you just look at my track record of what we did when I ran the chemical analysis business, we drove the profitabilities year in and year out and improved it and\xe2\x80\xa6.
Didier Hirsch
There is no reason why our contribution margin of over 30% would slow down beyond 2017.
Mike McMullen
Yes. And specifically at Thermo, I am not sure if their commitment was 25% in the analytical business or the overall company. So \xe2\x80\x93 but again, we are \xe2\x80\x93 we laid out we believe with pretty ambitious goals.
Tycho Peterson
And then just to follow up on the M&A questions earlier, what\xe2\x80\x99s the maximum leverage ratio you are comfortable with? And should we assume an emphasis on consumables for your comments in terms of where you are directing M&A?
Mike McMullen
Just to make sure I understand the question, so the question was what\xe2\x80\x99s our....
Tycho Peterson
Where do you top out on leverage for deals? Where do you feel comfortable going to?
Didier Hirsch
I mean, we have a lot of room for maneuver. Obviously, we have to make sure that the M&A does generate EBITDA, but obviously, if it\xe2\x80\x99s offshore, there is no issue. If it is in the U.S., we could even \xe2\x80\x93 I mean we could go beyond three for a period of time of leverage and then come back to where we think we need to be about 2.3 \xe2\x80\x93 2.2.
Mike McMullen
I think it\xe2\x80\x99s more almost than \xe2\x80\x93 obviously want to make sure that we understand the perspective of the bondholder, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s more making sure that you find targets that make sense and are accretive and can get the kind of return for the company, because you know the market is \xe2\x80\x93 the assets are highly valued right now.
Isaac Ro
Good morning. Thanks. Isaac Ro from Goldman. I just want to spend time deconstructing what you said so far on the current guidance for the next three years. If we look at the top line, you want to grow a little faster than your markets. On the SG&A side, you mentioned reorienting the sales force a little bit. And on the R&D side, it seems like you are pretty comfortable with the spend that you have. If we put that altogether, you also want to raise margins. So, it seems like a little bit like you are kind of trying to do a lot of things on multiple fronts and it\xe2\x80\x99s to me a little \xe2\x80\x93 so little unclear how you achieve all of those things in concert, specifically on the organic growth side. If you are going to continue to spend what you are spending and reorient the sales force, is it really a function of just changing what projects you invest in, shutting down some and prioritizing others, because it just seems a little difficult to accelerate growth while also raising margins given the competitiveness of the environment?
Mike McMullen
Yes, well, thanks for the support for your earlier response. But just from me, just a few top line comments here, then you can feel to jump in, Didier, which was the path forward, $4.2 billion from gross margin, $2 billion from expenses, cost reductions, 60% of that come as an organic. We are really, really confident that not only has the sales force helps on the margin side, but it actually is going to be a driver for our forward-looking growth. So, I actually think that you can do both, which is drive growth and also lean out your structure. And you are exactly right, the focus on the R&D spending \xe2\x80\x93 yes, well, I am just bringing it down a bit in terms of the overall percent of revenue, but the real focus is to make sure that we are putting our money in the right places. And for example, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I aggregated all of the mass spec spends under one leader, because mass spectrometry is a huge opportunity for growth. We are a leader in that space, but there is more upside for us. So, what I am trying to do is have fewer, but more focused debts with our R&D spend. And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s coupled with a streamlined sales force, very clear when we had \xe2\x80\x93 before we had multiple sales forces with multiple sales force leaders, I have two, one for the Diagnostics and Genomics Group and one for everything else. So, our ability to drive our business forward and in terms of a go-to-market strategy I think is so much more simple, so much more clear. We have fewer people involved in discussions. We can just move faster. My response earlier to Derik\xe2\x80\x99s question about how can we build out our business in academia and research and life science. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just about the portfolio. It\xe2\x80\x99s also about the channel rates. So, yes, there are a lot of things we are trying to do, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s quite doable.
Isaac Ro
That\xe2\x80\x99s helpful. Thanks. And then just a follow up maybe more philosophical, yes, I think it was touched on earlier. You have seen some pretty sizable consolidating moves in the industry over the last three or four years. If I look at sort of the complex \xe2\x80\x93 context of what you are giving here, it seems a little more inward facing, right? You are focused on cleaning up the business, giving a lot of dollars back to shareholders. What\xe2\x80\x99s your view just on the importance of consolidation in this industry on a 5-year or 10-year basis? I mean, you guys have great scale in most of your markets, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like you feel like you need to be a complete juggernaut across all these markets to, if you will, is that fair?
Mike McMullen
Yes, I always start from the customer perspective, right, which is I am not sure that customers are looking for us just to staple a bunch of businesses together under their banner of Agilent. I think that \xe2\x80\x93 of course, I am driven to drive this company to larger size, larger market capitalization, higher share price, higher TSR, but we think we are in a really strong position today at $4 billion with our global reach. With our organic growth plan, we will continue to do meaningful tuck-in acquisitions. We think we can build out a business that we can really stand on our own and compete with anybody, so\xe2\x80\xa6
Didier Hirsch
Alright. Clearly, in the markets where we compete, I mean, in analytical labs, customers see Agilent against Waters, against Thermo analytical instruments, not the whole of Thermo and they wanted to buy some of the companies that really helps them be successful in their experiment from the cost and scientific standpoint. We think we are well positioned.
Mike McMullen
Yes, I am really trying to drive the company forward to really improve our focus and cover customers and really make ourselves even more competitive in this marketplace because the markets are going to be solid and \xe2\x80\x93 but the heyday of China growing double-digit and from a market standpoint, they are gone. So, the emerging \xe2\x80\x93 the explosion of emerging market growth rates that we saw over the last 10 years, I think we are not going to be there. So, you really have to make yourself as competitive you can in the marketplace to capture share from your competitors and that\xe2\x80\x99s really what we are focused on.
Tim Evans
Tim Evans with Wells Fargo Securities. I certainly appreciate the de-risking of the margin story from the organic revenue growth, but if we focus purely on the change in your long-term revenue growth guidance relative to last year, independent of what it means for margin, I am curious why the 6% in 2016 and \xe2\x80\x9817, it comes down to 5% and why we see the deceleration from 7% this year down to 5%? What end markets there are changing in your mind?
Mike McMullen
How about if I take it first around that, Didier?
Didier Hirsch
Yes.
Mike McMullen
And then when we looked at guidance for this year and as the number you guys have pointed out to me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty aggressive guidance. And I think what I think you are hearing \xe2\x80\x93 I hope you are hearing the tone too with Agilent is the company wants to be aggressive and move forward. But when I went through the explanation, what was driving that \xe2\x80\x93 a lot of it I have to say was fairly easy compares in a few of our businesses. I mean, I think we have been very, very public about our challenges that we had in our DDG business. And we have now got that business back in the trajectory of growth. So, I think it really is in a deceleration of any end-markets in particular. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a recognition of perhaps the higher upfront growth rate plan for 2015 versus our longer term growth aspirations in \xe2\x80\x9816 and \xe2\x80\x9817. I think 2015 was a year where we had kind of a \xe2\x80\x93 in a couple of our businesses easier comparison. I try to reflect that in the guidance as opposed to sandbagging numbers, but Didier, I don\xe2\x80\x99t if you have anything you would add to that?
Didier Hirsch
Yes, I mean, nothing to add obviously. We wanted to be very, very responsible and provide the number that we can commit to with some upside.
Mike McMullen
And as Didier mentioned, if we do more on the organic growth, it goes to the bottom line.
Miroslava Minkova
Hi, Miroslava Minkova with Stifel. Maybe to follow-up on some of the earlier questions, Mike, do you take the reigns, help us understand what do you see as the biggest opportunities in the next few years for the new, more focused Agilent? And one of the comments that struck me was moving the portfolio towards more recurring revenues, maybe just help us understand the pathway to get there, you said internal projects or tuck-in M&As or \xe2\x80\x93 and what might be your target there?
Mike McMullen
Yes, great question. If I understand the question, it was really, Mike, what do you think about some of the biggest opportunities you have for the company? If you look at the one slide we have, we talked about the key measure of success. And I would just refer you back to that, thinking about our ability to further penetrate our share in pharma, biopharma, life sciences, research, mass spectrometry, and particularly LC/MS, it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge opportunity for us to gather growth. It\xe2\x80\x99s both a share gain opportunity in a strong growing market. I also think that the CrossLab story you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from Mark, the ACG story, that\xe2\x80\x99s a big part of our growth story. And actually is a big part of why I did Varian a few years ago. And I talked about it today, about the economics of the lab. I believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s a change going on in the marketplace that customers want to help with their operations. It\xe2\x80\x99s no longer just about who\xe2\x80\x99s got the best technology in the marketplace. So I think I restructured the company on that. That was one my of interview points, I think helped me get the job, which was having to architect the strategy that you see, what Mark just led to, really, really strong growth. And then in Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s business, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about the pathology business, getting back growth there. We have got some really nice bets that you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear later on companion diagnostics. And we haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked about it too much this morning, is also next-gen sequencing. We have a really nice solution upfront with SureSelect and HaloPlex in our workflow. And then we just made an acquisition that helps clinicians, but the biggest challenge we had data interpretational labs. So, my response would be the 60 measures that we laid out for the company.
Miroslava Minkova
And a quick follow-up on the R&D spend, do you need to be spending 8% on R&D longer term and what\xe2\x80\x99s assumed in your operating margin targets?
Mike McMullen
Yes, I think as what we have said is, you saw it on some of the peers, what you want to look out \xe2\x80\x93 I always told Didier that P&L doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lie in terms of how you run your business. So, I think the right focus is are we delivering the right operating margin and the right organic growth for the company. I believe innovation, R&D is part of that story. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the only part of that story. You go to market, your channels is also a big part of that. But you are also going to see that I had a different view of just how much so I have been streamlining it and also where we are spending it. So, we moved more of our money, shipped the money into shorter-term projects with the timeframe of 2 to 3 years and we are also placing fewer bets, but more sizable bets. So, I think the way I have been thinking about it is and what the question we often get is, it\xe2\x80\x99s don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me about the percentage, but tell me what you are doing with it and are you getting the yield on it, okay?
Jon Groberg
Jon Groberg from UBS. So, Mike, most of us have been coming to Agilent Investor Days for a long time. You have talked a lot around being you are not a holding company you are One Agilent employees are all compensated on the same metrics. So, can you maybe help us understand outside of the fact that you split off electronic measurement, what is really different organizationally within the firm? And then two, what do you want to be known for three years from now when people come back to another Investor Day? What do you want to be known for? What do you want people to be saying about you?
Mike McMullen
Yes, thanks, Jon. Two excellent questions. I got to think about \xe2\x80\x93 is it too early to think about a legacy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but in response to your first question, if you are in the company, you would see a dramatically changed organizational structure streamlined. For example, four sales forces \xe2\x80\x93 excuse me, five sales forces down to two. The creation of a brand new business unit called ACG, which is all geared towards driving this enterprise \xe2\x80\x93 lab enterprise management business we talked about earlier. You would see dramatically fewer divisions. You would see 10% less Vice Presidents. You would see a very cohesive, collaborative executive team working together with different metrics. I pay these guys different now. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just about the results of their business, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the results of the total company, which I think drives us to make sure we don\xe2\x80\x99t only account for TSR returns. You would see a different view of what\xe2\x80\x99s corporate versus business, so by clapping those things, we have to change our legacy model. So I think you would see a \xe2\x80\x93 if you would talk to employees they would say, okay we have a much more simple, clear, organizational structure. It\xe2\x80\x99s easier to get things done. It\xe2\x80\x99s easier to get decisions made. And then we have had a legacy of perhaps too much inward energy and silo optimization. So that\xe2\x80\x99s why I have talked today about One Agilent. And for the investors and the owners to say, what this means is this team is really \xe2\x80\x93 and I would encourage you at the break to talk to some of the other members of Agilent. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s really going to make a difference in terms of how do we get to market faster and how we put our energies in the right places. If I \xe2\x80\x93 when we are here together in 3 years, what I hope you are saying is, Mike did and delivered on what he said he was going to do.
Johannes Arnold
Hi, Johannes Arnold from Gabelli & Company. You said that one of the biggest risks to your story is that you might be wrong or that you could be wrong about your expectations in China, could you elaborate on what expectations?
Mike McMullen
Yes. No, so I \xe2\x80\x93 the reason I highlighted that one by the way is just so much of the industry\xe2\x80\x99s growth is dependent on a strong China. And I think the demise of the China market is overstated. I am probably in China three or four times a year because I believe you have to be in a market to understand what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. I was recently there for the BoA conference, where we participated in a major food safety seminar. I have spent time with the customers, etcetera, etcetera. I think that market is going to have growth in it. What I was referring to earlier, the idea that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be multiples of three or four over the U.S., I mean over GDP I think that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen. So we saw one period of time the analytical market was probably growing 10%, 15%. We think the market is going to be in a GDP range and we think our business can be in the high single-digits in China.
So if you think about \xe2\x80\x93 if you look at the profile of how much of our business is in China, I need that high single-digit growth in China to hit \xe2\x80\x93 to help me hit my 5%. So that\xe2\x80\x99s why I was just highlighting for you, if you will one key attribute of our organic growth story. I personally don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that you are going to see a massive retrenching of spends in China. The markets are becoming increasingly competitive. But at the same point in time, priorities for the government line up directly with our end markets, whether it would be cleaning up the environment, there is going to be a mass amount of money spent in the environment, continued spending in food safety, whole area of human health, pharma. So some of the industries are more mature, like say the chemical energy \xe2\x80\x93 industry in China, but other aspects of the market, I suspect will continue to grow quite strongly. So please don\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand my comments. I am \xe2\x80\x93 I remain bullish on China, but also realistic in terms of what we can expect from an already sizable market. But still backed up by depending on how you look at 6% to 7% GDP growth.
Dan Leonard
Dan Leonard from Leerink, just another follow-up question on your M&A thinking, first off what\xe2\x80\x99s the ceiling on what you consider a tuck-in deal at this point?
Mike McMullen
Our definition of tuck-in, so I think we have got probably 500\xe2\x80\xa6
Didier Hirsch
Nothing \xe2\x80\x93 yes, I mean nothing that compares to Dako or Varian. But \xe2\x80\x93 so usually the kind of deals that we do are between $20 million and $150 million, $200 million, it could be $250 million.
Mike McMullen
Yes.
Dan Leonard
Okay. And Mike, in your response to Dane\xe2\x80\x99s question it didn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like you were averse to a large deal, but it sounded like you rather wanted to stabilize your organization first, do you need to see a year of stability, 2 years of stability before you would revisit that thinking or do you want to execute on all...?
Mike McMullen
Yes. I think our \xe2\x80\x93 the capital priorities are laid out for tuck-in acquisitions. And I think I have told that up to $500 million or so $1 billion I could do per year. But I really think we have to do two things. One is we have to have the foundations set for the company. And we also have to deliver on a major bet we have already made. So I think the strategy is the strategy I presented today, which is we are going to stay focused on that 3 year profile and use our cash that\xe2\x80\x99s not returned to \xe2\x80\x93 available cash will be available for tuck-in acquisitions.
Didier Hirsch
So it\xe2\x80\x99s basically to \xe2\x80\x93 often it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be to complete a workflow. So it\xe2\x80\x99s not a major -- very broad product line with an extraordinarily broad footprint. But when we can leverage and provide the synergies by basically completing a workflow and selling that workflow throughout the world through our very strong worldwide presence.
Mike McMullen
So I would prefer not to put out a time on it, but just maybe just share my current thinking is some big deal is not top of mind right now for me and what we want to do for the company. I think we have other priorities that we laid out today.
Dwight Blazin
Dwight Blazin from Davis Funds, good to see you. Thanks for doing this. Just a quick question on capital allocation and the return, you have given us a lot of detail on your commitment to repurchase stock over the next few years and you have accounted for all the variables that are knowable. Of course the most important one is not knowable and that is the share price and the actual shareholder return for those repurchases. Based on what we are looking at for sort of free cash flow distributions this year, the return on repurchasing Agilent stock is about 3.8%. As you sort of weigh the options out there, how does that 3.8% for repurchasing Agilent stock compared with the alternatives. And you mentioned that Agilent is doing well from a valuation standpoint, which sure \xe2\x80\x93 which basically communicates the notion that the return on Agilent stock is lower than it was last year at this time. And if you are successful in escalating the operating margin, presumably the return on repurchases are going to go down over the next few years?
Didier Hirsch
Well, if we would stop at 22%, once it\xe2\x80\x99s all baked in the stock price, which we don\xe2\x80\x99t think yet, and then we don\xe2\x80\x99t think yet, it\xe2\x80\x99s totally baked in. I mean we are very, very confident about future opportunities and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we would be in the market. And but we are doing it in a manner also which we believe is very, very responsible and disciplined. And we certainly would love to be in a position that \xe2\x80\x93 I mean we want to be also \xe2\x80\x93 I mean we provided kind of this $380 million with opportunities to scale up or down on the annual \xe2\x80\x93 I mean on the quarterly basis or I mean we did a year with new things, the $380 million makes total sense and we will be able to buyback at that level, but certainly, opportunistically, within the year and scaling up and down as we see fit. But thanks for asking the question because I mean you are basically demonstrating basically what we have heard also from the perception study. There is a lot of distant feedback coming from our investors and analysts and it\xe2\x80\x99s somehow very common and others are really interesting.
Mike McMullen
But ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s the owner\xe2\x80\x99s cash and they just have weigh to get it. I think we probably have time for one more question before we break for lunch and...
Daniel Arias
Good morning Mike.
Mike McMullen
Good morning.
Daniel Arias
Daniel Arias from Citi. You talked about being in areas where you are the market leader and where you occupy the position in that you are looking for. I guess when you look at the organization today, do you see product lines or areas of the business where it may still make sense to exit or divest or when you look at the portfolio, I am pretty happy with what you have here?
Mike McMullen
Yes, great question. So if you saw that kind of one slide I laid out, a 3-year road map and I have talked about, targeted portfolio rationalization being done. But then I would think I had a little tagline there, something about continuing reviews, right. So the first part, response to your question be is, yes we have completed the portfolio review. Very happy with where we are because we think that we have path forward to win and grow a share in all these businesses. In two product lines, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t that was the case. One was the NMR business, we mentioned earlier. The XRD business is a nice product line, but it was in the wrong hand. We were really sub-scaled to be successful and really get a meaningful win there.
So the answer would be very satisfied with where we are today. But the rigor that we showed, which was if our bets over the next year or 2 years aren\xe2\x80\x99t planning \xe2\x80\x93 paying out the way we want, we will \xe2\x80\x93 hopefully, we won\xe2\x80\x99t be in that position because we have got a lot of confidence in the plan we\xe2\x80\x99ve put together. But we are going to show that discipline to continue to look at our portfolio, can we win, can we differentiate, is there meaningful win there for us? But right now, we are quite pleased with what we have, but this is going to part of the new Agilent, which is we will continue to be \xe2\x80\x93 going to do our portfolio. So, I think what I was told was we are going to provide a wonderful box lunch for all of you. And that we will reconvene here in 30 minutes at 12 o\xe2\x80\x99clock. We will pick up the discussions with the group presidents, starting with Patrick Kaltenbach in the LSAG review. And again, thank you so much for the great engaging questions.
[Break]
Patrick Kaltenbach
Alright. May I ask everybody please to take a seat? We would like to continue with the afternoon session. So, welcome everybody to our afternoon session. So, this afternoon, you will hear now from all the group presidents about the strategy of the individual groups. I will kick it off with Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group. So, together with ACG, we are addressing a $35 billion market opportunity, which is a huge market. And when you look at last year\xe2\x80\x99s revenue, LSAG achieved about $2.1 billion revenue, excluding ACG and brought home a very high operating margin of 18%. Moving forward, with our strong innovation engine with a clear market focused strategy our goal is to take more market share. We will do this with a customer-centric approach delivering exceptional value proposition on very highly differentiated solutions. And I will highlight several of those solutions throughout my presentation.
Now, in the more than 200,000 labs, we are addressing worldwide, our customers have a common set of challenges, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s about robustness and reliability to ensure uptime, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s higher performance to push the science forward or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s reducing cost per sample and driving more efficiency to bring the cost of ownership down. We have structured our group into five major divisions: mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, microfluidics, spectroscopy and vacuum and software and informatics. These five groups are really focused on driving solutions to the market, a highly differentiated and at the same time leverage the underlying platforms. We will address our five end markets, pharma, academia and government, food, environmental, chemical and energy with one global phase channel with a very strong go-to-market strategy.
Now, looking at our end markets, these are all sizable markets with very, very healthy growth rates. They are, as Mike said, addressing the most significant challenges of our generation, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s our environmental issues that we have, healthy food, safe waters, if it\xe2\x80\x99s on the health demand in pharma and life science research or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the energy supply for the world to drive the economy. Now, we already have very strong positions in the applied markets. We are number one in food. We are number one in environmental and in chemical and energy. And we also have a strong number two position already in pharma. And even in the highly fragmented life science research space, we are holding a solid number five position. This means we are operating from a very strong foundation, but we still also have plenty of room to grow.
It\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that all of our five major divisions address all markets and most of the segments in these markets. This means we can highly leverage the underlying platforms and make sure that we not only drive poor performance and quality in these platforms, but at the same time drive cost down. We also offer highly scalable solutions from entry model systems to routine systems to high-end solutions addressing the need in the markets for lower cost, as well as routine instrumentation and high-end solution for more sophisticated tasks. Also, within these scalable solutions, we are highly leveraging the underlying platform to ensure that we achieve our operating margin goals moving forward. Now, many of our customers are using our platforms in routine applications, which means they are operating them in a 24/7 mode. And here are several examples about different markets and customer types.
Let me start with food testing, food safety and quality and food processing companies, for example, use a GC Triple Quad as a tool of choice and is also highly used in the academia and government space to make sure that we deliver safe food to customers. And on the petrochem side, oil companies use our GCs from the exploration as well as on the refinery side. And as oil is flowing into the chemical space as a feedstock, the GC is also the tool of choice to do material testing and material characterization. Then water supply, ensure water supply and safe water supply, is high on \xe2\x80\x93 with utility companies and also with government and academia test labs. The ICP-MS solutions and we have a broad bandwidth of these solutions in our portfolio, are the tool of choice here to really look at elemental analysis. And on the disease research side, the Life Science and that market actually a broad base of tools is applied. One tool that I really want to highlight is LC/MS, because this is a very important toolset for us.
And with this toolset, I also want to highlight an application space, which is metabolite ID. We are a market leader in metabolomics and we have a very broad portfolio on this and it\xe2\x80\x99s highly leveraged in the academia space. We are planning to move this forward in the adjacent spaces of metabolomics and glycomics and lipidomics as well. And another great application example is the analysis with more molecule drugs, QA/QC, which is highly used in pharma companies and biopharma companies. They really rely on our platforms to provide 24/7 uptime. And therefore for example, our Infinity II LC series is in many cases the first choice for these pharma companies.
So, let me also highlight, talk a little bit about innovation engine. Let me highlight some of the key innovations and new products we launched last year. On the mass spec side, from the mass spec platform last year, we launched a 6495 LC Triple Quad, which is the most sensitive Triple Quad system on the market. This is very important when you look at lowest levels of detection limits and at the same time rely on the stability of the underlying platform. Q4 last year, we launched the Infinity II series, our latest platform in liquid chromatography and it has been a huge success so far for us. It\xe2\x80\x99s simply the best-in-class performance and flexible system on the market. It drives a lot of momentum for us. We have grown in the second quarter more than 10% on the LC side, which is I think clearly beating the market right now.
Then on the gas chromatography side, GCMS, last year, we launched GC/Q-TOF system, which is a highly differentiated solution when it comes to accurate mass high resolution measurements, which is simply the first tool of choice for many of our customers. And if you combine it with our software solutions like our pesticide libraries, you have a world-class pesticide screening solution.
Another platform I want to highlight here is spectroscopy. And we brought last year the 5100 ICP-OES systems to the market, which is another great success and I highlighted on the separate slide as well. This is one \xe2\x80\x93 this is based on one of our four Varian platforms. It is simply the most productive and lowest cost of ownership system when it comes to trace level analysis of elements. Then on the software side, OpenLAB is our upcoming software platform. It\xe2\x80\x99s a system that has the scalability from single workstation to network data systems and we continue to evolve this with multi-vendor, multi-technique capabilities moving forward. Just two months ago, we launched the last release of our OpenLAB ELN, the Electronic Lab Notebook, which has also exciting new features.
Now, let me give you some highlights in terms of differentiation, why we think differentiation is so important? I will start with an application and with a system out of the applied market space. This is about analysis of water and wastewater. Many of these customers have to process a huge amount of samples. And at the same time, they are under tremendous cost pressure when it comes to cost per sample. They are looking at systems that are extremely robust based on the samples they have to process. And at the same time, they are facing regulatory demands when it comes to sensitivity etcetera. So, our answer to this challenge was our 5100 ICP-OES systems. Compared to other systems in the market, when you do an ICP-OES measurement, most of the instruments out there, you have to use the sequence of measurements to get to the full picture and then it comes to elemental analysis.
What customers do is they first have to select which elements are measured in the so-called radio mode or in an excellent mode in the plasma system. And then some of the systems also use two different optical setups for high wavelengths and low wavelengths, which leads you up to four sequential measurements to come to the full analysis. Now, this of course drives costs. And what is driving cost in the system like that is the argon consumption. Simply speak, the longer the test takes, the more argon you have to use and the more expensive the test is. Now, our system, the 5100 ICP-OES has used only one test for sample and this has a couple of very differentiated features inside, like the Dichroic Spectral Combiner, which basically combines the axial and the radial view of the plasma into one measurement. This drives cost of sample down for our customer and leads for us to a very fast uptake when it comes to systems. So, we have seen an uptick in instruments sold compared to last year by more than 50% and we estimate we have calculated that we have taken about 7 points market share in this domain in the last year. And this tells you how highly differentiated solutions really drive growth for us as a company.
The second solution that I want to highlight is our industry leading metabolomics portfolio. Customers in life science research, as well as in pharma, for example, in disease discovery, have to look at very complex data sets to quantitate cellular metabolites, to understand metabolic pathways, to measure toxicity or to elucidate nutritional environmental impacts. What they need are very comprehensive hardware and software solutions. Agilent not only has the broadest bandwidth in terms of hardware solutions. We have the LT, the Q-TOF solutions and Triple Quad solutions as well the GC/Q-TOF and Triple Quad solutions. But more importantly, we also have a very strong software suite base on our MassHunter platform this allows customers to easily identify statistically meaningful metabolized and make very, very fast conclusions on what is important in these measurements. We also use our compound databases and libraries to look at metabolite identification combined with our Q-TOF hardware resolutions and when it comes to targeted quantitation of no metabolites in complex samples like plasma, our Triple Quad, our tools of choice. And I mentioned the high sensitivity solution, like LC Triple Quad before, which is really an instrument that is very well performing and is also highly received in this field.
What we have seen over the last years is almost consistently a growth rate of about 15% in LC/MS systems used in this domain. And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s really a combination of the software capabilities we have and our hardware capabilities. We surely can claim that we are number one in metabolomics as the research field with our solutions. And we are now at a stage where we strongly push this forward into adjacent spaces of glycomics and lipidomics.
Let me also spend a few words on our biggest markets opportunity, China. In fiscal year \xe2\x80\x9814, we sold about 23% of our solutions in China LSAG. Those market demands or the market drivers are strong, as Mike highlighted already at the beginning. There is a strong demand in the population for safer food and a more health \xe2\x80\x93 and safer water. And the government is putting more and more regulations into place to ensure the safer environment for its population. This is a strong place for us to play with our GC, GCMS, ICP-MS solutions to help monitor air quality, water and soil. Then when you look at China as a manufacturing place, it\xe2\x80\x99s the most important manufacturing place in the world and specifically, for example, in fine chemicals. Our tools in separations, LC and GC, as well as our spectroscopy tools, are highly used in this domain as well.
When you look at life science research in China, the academia government space is growing fast. The metabolomics play is a strong play for us. And with our setup there, we have strong academia sales channel in this field, and we also have a strong connection to the academia space in China. This is helping us to drive momentum in China is also the perspective for us moving forward. Now, looking at pharma and biopharma, there certainly is a strong demand from these customers to help them to ensure the quality of their products. And this is where our solutions in LC, I mentioned for example quality, QC of pharmaceuticals come in place and drive momentum.
Overall, we expect this market to grow for us about 9% over the next two years. And I think with the momentum we have, with the strong connection we have in the fields, we have a very strong footprint. We have a very strong relationship with our customers. And we have the right portfolio to help these customers moving forward. I am confident that we can achieve this growth.
So, let me summarize what is important for us as Agilent moving forward. As Mike mentioned, we are after growth. We will drive this group to the 45% market growth between fiscal year \xe2\x80\x9815 and \xe2\x80\x9817. It\xe2\x80\x99s also our clear goal to drive operating margin further up. I said we have a very strong footprint in most of our markets. We are number one in the applied markets, a strong footprint in pharma. So, there is a strong baseline we can build on. The key growth initiatives we will have over the next couple of years are certainly pharma and academia and government. In pharma, there is a strong momentum when it comes to the shifts from new chemical entities to neurobiological entities. So, biopharma is certainly a space where we see strong growth moving forward and where we also do a higher investment in our portfolios to support a demand in the space.
Then on the academia side, with our genomics solutions, we will use our strength in oligo synthesis to drive the genomic solutions forward. In terms of platform plays, Mike said this morning LC/MS is the fastest growing segment for us. It\xe2\x80\x99s also one of the spaces where we have plenty of room to grow. We have seen strong momentum over the last several quarters, continuously with double-digit growth and with a new set up with one combined MS group, we are sure that we can make the right investments in R&D to continue to drive momentum and to continue to capture market share in the space. I already spoke on my slide earlier about the potential we see in China. We think with the right educated solutions for China, we will be able to ride \xe2\x80\x93 continue to ride there and even grow above the market growth in China. 
And last but not least, I also want to highlight again our software and informatics platforms. Our OpenLAB platform continues to evolve its multi-vendor and multi-technique capabilities with the next releases and this will also help my colleague, Mark, from the ACG organization to unlock new opportunities for ACG.
And with that, I will directly lead over to Mark.
Mark Doak
Alright and thanks Patrick. First, open this up by saying, I am very glad to be here obviously my first time, somewhat in awe of the facility and of the, if you will, just the rich history here and it\xe2\x80\x99s glad to join you today to talk about our business.
Agilent CrossLab Group, it is a new group we formed back in August. It\xe2\x80\x99s a collection from a P&L perspective of supplies, chemistries and services. That\xe2\x80\x99s what the P&L is. However, from a business perspective, our group supports all of our business in trying to drive growth, obviously, market share and improved earnings for our shareholders. So, to that extent, Patrick and I work collaboratively together. I share \xe2\x80\x93 I hold the services across the company from an organizational perspective. The software and informatics investments we are making frankly, if you look at the world, software is eating the world. Software is such a big component of how companies have to go forward. It\xe2\x80\x99s highly integrated in our strategies and services and it\xe2\x80\x99s enabling us to do a lot more at the laboratory enterprise level.
And then in the Diagnostics and Genomics business with Jacob, it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a case that we have some great capabilities and scale. We also have a great strategy of how we enable the lab and we are taking that over into the diagnostics business. So, to set the stage from this win in lab productivity, productivity in laboratory, in my experience in this industry over the last 30 years, the drive towards improving cost, improving throughput at the lab is at all-time high. And there is a lot of factors behind that. And companies increasingly are looking for help here. They are looking for us to bring integrated solutions to the table, bring all of our capabilities to the company together to help them. And they are looking for us to help them with their outcomes. So, those outcomes can be finding a trade biological in a water sample. It can be speeding time-to-market or frankly it can be making the laboratory more productive. So, this is a very customer-focused strategy. And as you might see here, our goal is to provide insights to help customers achieve their specific outcomes. And we will talk about how we intend on doing that.
We start with what I think is a very strong base with the company, very financially sound in the group, $1.3 billion in revenues and 23% operating margins in 2013. You can see these trends point to lab wide solutions. And part of that is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a very large market. And once you have a large install base, if you do a little bit of the math, 265,000 labs, just for Agilent, maybe there is four assets. There is 1 million assets in play. So, when I talk about assets, it\xe2\x80\x99s the instruments inside the install base. So, how do you \xe2\x80\x93 it becomes an obvious big component of how customers spend their money and they look to optimize that and we are there to help them along those lines. It\xe2\x80\x99s an attractive and growing market of the $45 billion we don\xe2\x80\x99t have an exact number, a precise number. What we can tell you is a significant amount being spent in this area. And in many cases the spend is outgrowing the instruments growth in these areas.
And we look at \xe2\x80\x93 I look at all of the assets of the lab as the opportunity. Although we love everybody to buy Agilent equipment, we know it\xe2\x80\x99s not always the case, but in many cases, based on our \xe2\x80\x93 really our technical prowess and our operational prowess, we can actually improve the performance of other vendors equipment and we do. So, attractive and growing market potential. And then you need presence. One of that is just our size and scale, which I will talk to in a minute, but the other aspect of this is actually we have been very successful in our lab productivity work. We started this group 2010. And it\xe2\x80\x99s grown significantly over the past few years. And what it has done is this has allowed us to act to different decision-makers in the laboratory, either at a regional or global level, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also starting to open doors for us to come in and talk more about what the power of Agilent can do in the laboratory. And that\xe2\x80\x99s really the exciting part. So, CrossLab is bringing all the power of our instruments, software, consumables and services to bear in the marketplace.
So, let\xe2\x80\x99s come back to the challenges out there. I would say the more for less mantra is not a new one. How customers have to address it is a new one. And if we start with the team lead or the, if you will, the user in the lab, it\xe2\x80\x99s more than just running the sample. This pressure is on, can I get the throughput I need for the work I need to get done today? If you move over to the lab manager, they are working with an extraordinary amount of complexity and there\xe2\x80\x99s factors in play here. One of those factors is just the regulatory environment that they work in.
Second one is in fact the technology itself. Patrick talked about some very sophisticated technology, some science that is at leading edge, working in that area. And the third one, frankly, is this move towards more biological testing whether that\xe2\x80\x99s in water or other areas, so higher level complexity, they are saying, how do I reduce my complexity? And in many cases, they say, that\xe2\x80\x99s not core. I can outsource that and I will come to a company like Agilent to help me with that. And on the procurement side, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many of you have followed the pharmaceutical industry, but labs literally have accumulated tens of thousands of assets.
And frankly, they can answer some very fundamental questions about it. Where is it? How effective is it being utilized? What age is it? And is it the right match for the signs I have at hand? And I will talk to a case study later, that\xe2\x80\x99s an actual customary work with around this, but those are really some challenging questions for those and they are really looking for how can you come forward and in essence help me be more productive, save me cost. So, all of this comes back to what we see is the trend towards help us in our laboratory operations, help us in our network to be more effective around that.
So, I would like to say the heart of our value proposition really is around innovation. And to that end, I will talk more about what some of those innovative areas that much like Patrick said our intent is to differentiate ourselves in the market. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a me-too player around that. Part of why we win is our scale though. We have a global supply chain led by Henrik and that supply chain can deliver parts next day around the globe to the tune of $40,000 per month. We have, because of the size and scale and the approach in our service business, we have an extraordinary amount of touch points or access to our customers. And you can see some of the statistics. We touch 6,000 customers a day, $1.4 million transactions per year in terms of contact list. And we spend about 2.8 million hours onsite with our customers every year. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s an extraordinary amount of time just in the context of helping customers rate in terms of account relationship and frankly building a trusted partner relationship.
I will share some about the chemistries, about the innovations around this. On the chemistry side, one of those areas is in the inert flow path and their flow path actually allows you to provide a path for the samples that could glom on to the sample and actually reduce the sensitivity of it and our proprietary technology that improves the accuracy. In the services side, we have an enterprise compliance management system, which actually takes the data, validates the performance of the data, presents it across all platforms in a very, very accurate way and a very \xe2\x80\x93 in a standardized way across as it lowers the compliance risk and lowers the cost to our customer to do this. And then the OpenLAB area, we see this as the platform across all our businesses. It\xe2\x80\x99s a, if you will, a system that allows us to connect across multiple vendors and ultimately, enables our position in what we are doing in Enterprise Asset Management. So, all of this has actually resulted in some pretty impressive financial performance.
You can look back at the growth that we see over the \xe2\x80\x9810 to \xe2\x80\x9814 period, 11%. A big portion of this is Varian in this business. And we brought Varian into \xe2\x80\x93 this has been actually just a remarkable business from the ACG point of view, brought Varian in. They are connect rates in the aftermarket we are half of Agilent\xe2\x80\x99s. Their profitability were 4 to 5 points lower, brought them in. And we have actually seen the growth accelerate in that business and brought that profitability up. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s added scale to the business to the tune of 5,000 new products, but it\xe2\x80\x99s actually added growth profitability in the business. And frankly, it puts us in position where we can move forward with this broader offering around the enterprise solutions for our customers.
So, looking at the competitive landscape, the lab-wide solutions, is not new. In fact, we have been in this business now for approximately 10 years. I would say, it continues to accelerate, but in that context, there is actually three companies who are taking a broader competitive strength, ourselves, PerkinElmer and Thermo. But then from a customer point of view, they are really trying to drive what are those key process indicators in the laboratory to help them with. And a couple of samples would be reducing total cost of ownership, optimizing turnaround time.
So with our services, our technology investments, our platforms and informatics, we can actually help customers get at some of these key process indicators, help them fine tune their operations and improve them. We can, with our service consultants actually go in and help interpret the data and make better business decisions. And then, in the third part, with our enterprise capabilities, we can go in with chemistries and supplies and actually make custom components for our customers. But in the end, this business is what I call a custom business. You take all your capabilities. You understand what the customer\xe2\x80\x99s business drivers are. You come back, you put them together. And that\xe2\x80\x99s how you deliver the solution. And I will give you some examples around that. I think we are actually in a great position to compete in this marketplace with our size, scale, access points and core competencies in terms of our business.
So, where do we see our opportunities out there? So, out of this $45 billion market and we see this all is a potential for us and the big picture, we actually have an attack plan that starts at the lower left here around just seizing on the opportunities we have because of this access points and our dimensions around that. We move up into what I call asset optimization. That\xe2\x80\x99s the ability to actually get more out of the instrument itself. Patrick talked about some of the enabling technologies. Our job is actually to even take it further, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s technology adoption, services, application, consultancy that helps through that or tying workflows together.
And then on the asset optimization side of this, this is all about taking all the assets lab, the network and can we drive better cost structures and higher productivity through the laboratory. And last but not least, it\xe2\x80\x99s to be able to integrate more of these solutions together across software, informatics, I mean, software services and our consumables businesses and take some of the higher order services, I term them professional services, management consulting services and outsource services. And we are already on our way there it\xe2\x80\x99s really just expanding our presence in these areas. It\xe2\x80\x99s also multiple vectors to go after growth. Much like Patrick said, our products and services trends in markets, in many cases, fundamental services such as repair and maintenance, for instance, fulfill that role. We also look at the opportunity in the end markets to provide specific application services around those end markets. I would say that\xe2\x80\x99s another thing it\xe2\x80\x99s very different about the new Agilent as we plan to execute across the end markets and look for how we can tap that market space more effectively.
And then we actually come over to the vendors and platforms once again leveraging those, that we see our opportunity from the solution\xe2\x80\x99s stand point to start at the workflow, work to the lab, and then to the lab network. And the lab network, if you talk to many of our customers, our largest customers in the commercial labs now have consolidated. They might have hundreds of laboratories distributed across the globe. And they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for ways how they can tie all that information together if you will, balance the sample load in that network and truly get more effective, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re about with ACG, around what we can do in enterprise. So it all sounds good, but let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about a couple examples of what we are really doing in the laboratory today. The first one is a multinational in the pharma space. And a significant amount of time is spent just by the lab management to keep the lab up and running, make sure that the samples are running. They also had cost pressures, which is not new. And they are responding to an FDA warning letter. So, our response to this was come in and look at it from a total solution, building a custom solution as I talked about and what were their business drivers what they are trying to address? And the very first aspect of this is just managing the whole aspect of the lifecycle of the assets in their laboratory from acquisition to getting the best out of that and ultimately disposition and technology refresh in that laboratory.
And you can look at some of these numbers around the reduction in downtime. You can look at the number of this, but in the end, the users had better instrument availability. The procurement team had a simplified vendor landscape. And ultimately, their compliance risk is lowered as I talk, because we provided a truly harmonized and standardized instrument compliant service across the laboratory. Another one, this challenge is actually a little bit bigger. This customer had 20,000 assets across five sites. And I actually love to tell the story that when we did the inventory of the assets of all equipment in the lab, 25% of that was not in their asset management system. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon. So, they lost 5,000 pieces of gear. So, scientists are good at a lot of things. They are really not good at asset management. They need help.
And so to \xe2\x80\x93 in that context, we came in and we built a unified solution around services for this entire company and their R&D group. And bottom line is it\xe2\x80\x99s really driven what we call the ability for scientists to do science. It\xe2\x80\x99s taken a lot of the things, the complexity they had to manage, the service model they manage. In fact, we do vendor management for this company to ensure that that\xe2\x80\x99s not on their shoulders and that\xe2\x80\x99s part of how we play with this one. Once again, a big reduction in hard and then soft cost savings, but in the end, this is, when Mike talked about, the laboratory enterprise, this is what we can do in Agilent.
So, I have given you a glimpse of what \xe2\x80\x93 I will steal Mike\xe2\x80\x99s phrase of the new Agilent. I call this the new ACG, because we recognized a couple of years ago that we really didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a strong market message about what we could do in the marketplace. And as you can see of what I have talked to, it really has changed. It\xe2\x80\x99s far beyond the traditional services supporting Agilent\xe2\x80\x99s technology to being able to be a partner to come in and really help that customer to be effective across the lab and across the enterprise. And we are well poised to drive towards some of this high order of what I call business value services in the end.
So, looking from the growth perspectives and wrapping up around some of the growth initiatives that we see, starting foundationally with CrossLab, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to build the portfolio breadth to make sure we have a comprehensive solution around the laboratory. We will also look for areas that in context to convenience that we might have the OEM to provide that for customer. In the assets, if you will, in the solutions capability, I already talked about that from the standpoint of what we can do in applications consultancy, moving into the enterprise solutions I just discussed and you saw in actions. And the OpenLAB area is we talked about, we see our informatics solution being able to drive it across our entire company from an OpenLAB and we already have introduced a product that uses the system to actually gather part of our data for enterprise asset management.
And longer term, our work is underway to actually provide a unified informatics system that includes Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s business in diagnostics. So, from a growth perspective, very responsible ways, as Didier say, we see 5% to 6% is a very responsible way to look at it going forward. The arrow itself should be further up into the right. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t calibrate our arrows. Didier was negotiating for a high new arrow at lunch today. But long story short, we are part of our gross margin improvements. It\xe2\x80\x99s not indicated in the slide. So in the end, we are very confident on our ability to grow and differentiate ourselves. The numbers I put up here, we intend to outperform. And frankly, we have a track record of doing that. And with that, thank you for your time to talk about ACG.
I will pass it over to my colleague, Jacob and he can talk about what I think is also a very exciting opportunity for us in Diagnostics and Genomics.
Jacob Thaysen
Alright, thank you very much, Mark. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure for me to spend the next 20 minutes with you on the Diagnostics and Genomics Group with particular focus on the Agilent Clinical Research and Diagnostic strategy. And please also bear with me with my somewhat exotic Scandinavian accent, but I am sure you will get used to it, because also the next speaker, Henrik Ancher-Jensen will continue in the same kind of very beautiful accent here.
So, let me just remind you about where we are with Diagnostic and Genomics Group. We have six divisions with recently announced Cartagenia, but also the pathology, the rating partnership and the companion diagnostics businesses that came from the Dako acquisition. Then we also have the genomics business and finally the nucleic acid solution division. We have a starting point of $663 million last year, 14% operating margin and it\xe2\x80\x99s addressing a very nice market opportunity of $10 billion. What I would like to present you today is our winning strategy within the clinical and diagnostics segment. There is particular focus on the cancer and generic disorders that will drive our growth, but also bring us back to very attractive operating profit margins.
Overall, our aim is to enable our customers to be successful. And we do that by providing solutions that focus on that pain point in their daily lives, that being the clinician, the pathologist, the geneticist, that everyday has to do very difficult, complex decisions, complex diagnostic decisions. And we provide a broadband, a broad portfolio of high-quality and consistent assets that ensure the high level of certainty everyday, so then do that diagnostic challenges and results. Furthermore, we also address the lab manager and the lab tech that everyday is constrained by the budget, but have to deal with more and more volume growth through the laboratory without making any failures at all. And we do that by providing workflow solutions with a focus of turnaround time, productivity, but also interviews.
Our key focus areas are within the pathology area, where we today have more than 2,000 customers out there that use our solutions everyday. And we also have a great portfolio in the genomics space with more than 4,000 customers, particular in the genomic molecular labs, the CLIA labs in this high genetic space. We operate in the clinical, in the research clinical continuum, where we continue to see also that due to the complex test that is out there today that you can say the borderline between clinical research, early adopters and clinical routine phase-out, which really calls for players that can operate in that whole arena and we do that.
As I have told you upfront here, we are operating in a $10 billion market, but with a clear focus on pathology, genomics and also the emerging opportunity with our mass spec technologies, our addressable markets is in the number of $4 billion. But it also is a very, very attractive growth rate where you can see down here around 6% to 8% for pathology and all the way up to 14%, 16% for the genomics business. So let me also remind you that in DGG, we also \xe2\x80\x93 in DGG, we also had the genomics platform that addresses the academia government market with also a nice opportunity, but with a somewhat more moderate growth opportunity.
So I am truly excited to be a part of the Agilent team also. We talked about the One Agilent and what it really means is that we levered the strength across Agilent as a whole. We have great platform, the genomics, the FISH, the mass spec, the DNA, the QC-DNA technologies for the TapeStation and bioanalyzer that goes across multiple segments and addressed by multiple sales forces also. We do that in the analytical lab, clinical research, early adopters and diagnostics labs. And we also have as Mark talked about the CrossLab service organization that supports the diagnostic business also.
With the impressive footprint and global reach, we can address all laboratories around the world. And this is very exciting also. And we have put substantial investment into the OpenLAB platform, that is a great foundation in the laboratories as a bioinformatics tool to ensure that the laboratory have full control over the information flow. And thereby it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter where they sit in a clinical lab or environmental lab, it is the same kind of information you would need in the laboratory and get control over that. And our mindset within regulatory excellence and our compliance focus is really a key also. We understand our customers and we can provide solution to them. In reality again, a lab manager in environmental lab or in a diagnostic lab is facing the same challenges from living up to the regulatory compliance, delivering on the volume increase and also continue to build out on the constraint matters it\xe2\x80\x99s the same and it goes across all laboratories. This is what we do in Agilent. And we really can offer a bigger portfolio and a better offering to our customers than the individual groups could do on its own. And this is to me very, very exciting.
So let me home a little bit in on the clinical research and diagnostics opportunity. As you all know we are in the middle of the healthcare revolution today. With the advances in disease profiling and the acceleration of personal medicine also, this is a great opportunity. These things are fueled by the sequencing power, the big data and also the understanding of disease pathway and signaling pathways. All of this in the end has shown that within cancer, we can suddenly understand much more of a disease. We can certainly do much more detailed diagnosis that in the end will give you opportunity for the patient to get the right treatment much faster, of course for better treatment, but also for driving down the cost in the healthcare systems.
We know that around 60% to 70% of all drugs today, Tier 1 drugs, do not deliver on the expectations. But we also know that a much better disease profiling, particular by investing into diagnostics will increase that probability by putting the right treatment in front of the customer or the front of the patient at the same time. And ultimately, that is the goal both from a patient perspective, but also from a healthcare perspective. This is great opportunity for the clinician. But they are also faced with big challenges here, because from the pathologist that previously and also right now is looking at maybe 5, 6 assays per patient within staining now suddenly they also have to address all the information that comes from the molecular technologies. In order for them to be successful, it really requires vendors. But first and foremost have the domain knowledge, have the platforms are able to operate in an IVD environment, but also have the global commercial reach both from a sales perspective, but also from a sale and service and application perspective. And this is what only a few companies can do right now and Agilent is one of them. Therefore, we have selected three domain places where we believe we can do a sustainable difference for the customers out there. And that is continuing our fight against cancer by regaining staining leadership.
We want to do that first and foremost by accelerating our ominous placements out there, but also continuing with our industry best CoverStainer for the primary staining environment. We want to improve the quality of life through genomics solutions by identifying genetic disorders. And we already in there with our race and we will continue to build that out and really focusing on enabling the clinicians to make the right decision by simplifying the interpretation also. But we also believe that a key differentiator here is our domain understanding. We believe we can be an instrumental to lead the genomics adoption, lead the clinical adoption of genomics going forward also. With our key position already in sample prep, the automation, but also in the downstream now with the software and the clinical interpretation, we have a great starting point to drive that forward. And with our understanding of pathology lab, the cytogenetic lab and molecular lab, we have actually a differentiating position here.
And this is actually how we came to this, because these are not just taking out of the air, but we really carefully looked into first and foremost in the multi-dimensional domain of the market opportunity. Where do we first and foremost have a big presence that we have the domain knowledge, where can we make a sustainable difference and where can we also \xe2\x80\x93 where does it fits with Agilent\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities and where is it also great growth opportunities. And clearly, with a big \xe2\x80\x93 deep penetration we have in the pathologist space with our Dako branded products, our global reach we have a strong presence there and we want to continue to operate in that space driving advanced staining but also driving the molecular workflows into that. And the same in the molecular and cytogenetic space where we already have a strong presence here with the Agilent brand, but with our race, our target investments and so on and also now with the Cartagenia platform, we already have strong presence there and it makes very good sense for us to continue to move that into our sweet spot.
And we are already accelerating into this strategy. We are already operating within it in cancer. We continue to place more and more on this. Every quarter is a new record for us. We also are the leader within companion diagnostic. We have the broader span of pharma partners already in our portfolio. And we continue to improve our relationship with this pharma partner. The good example is Merck & Co. Merck & Co now coming out with PD-L1. We are working with them and I am very excited about the opportunities that fits with PD-L1, but I can also you tell that a lot of more opportunities that we have in our portfolio going forward. We have also recently launched an NGS cancer research panel that attacks 151 mutations out there. We believe this is a very great opportunity in the research space, but we also have the ambition to move that all the way into the clinical diagnostic regime.
On the genetic disorder, these are \xe2\x80\x93 we came out the first, the industry first target enrichment panel here that not only look at mutations, but also now can address copy number of variations in those and LOH on a genome wide base. We are the only one that can do that right now and takes a full power of the erase and combine that with the full power of sequencing. We can do this, and we have done this because we understand the customers what they need and we have a great technology background that can further leverage that through.
And finally, Cartagenia was the key strategic acquisition for us because in reality the biggest challenge that sits on the clinical labs today is really the interpretations. There are a lot of labs today that have sequences out there that understands how to do some of the sample prep, but really the massive amount of data and how to operate that, not in a research setting but in a diagnostic setting is very difficult. Cartagenia is the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading platform out there that was just built ground up on a platform that fully focuses on the diagnostic environment, on the diagnostic workflow, but also on the requirements to patient safety and so on LIS connectivity and so on and nobody else right now can do that. But we also see an opportunity with that platform, a cloud-based platform to build out algorithms on that so we can really upload data from the sequencing all the way up in the cloud, do the algorithms and bring it back in front of the clinicians as a real driver for making the interpretation. And this is more to come in the future.
However, I do also believe that with this strong understanding and the deep understanding we have in our domain, particularly the pathology space, we can do more than that. We can go out first and foremost and drive the individual workflows. But I also said from the pathologist point of view, he or she now has to operate not only the staining information and not only the genomics information, but look at all that in one concerted effort and make decisions based on that. We had the vision, and we want to drive it towards what we call the diagnostic cockpit, where the pathologist will sit with all the information in front of him or her or even bring into the tumor boards where you have all the experts, but get all the information in one go.
We believe we can do that by having very strong understanding and give the right results out of staining, primary staining and advanced staining and also with a strong focus on the sequencing workflow. Building all that together with the OpenLAB platform, that collects all the data and being able to present that in one format in front of the pathologist is really what they are looking for. Then you can start on top of that to build algorithms to improve your diagnostic efficacy and so on, but furthermore, it will also give a very, very strong comprehensive view for the lab manager to operate and optimize the workflows, the bottlenecks, hence, in the end increased productivity, but also reducing the chances and have key focus not on the individual test, but on the pacing cases. And this is all what it comes down to. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pacing cases with all the data that\xe2\x80\x99s matter not the individual workflow on the individual test.
We can do that. Right now, we have the portfolio to do so and this is what we are going to deliver over the next period of time. So, we are going to do that [indiscernible]. First and foremost, we want to deliver on our commitment to regain leadership in pathology, driven, of course, with the Omnis platform. We also, at the same time, are developing our clinical genomics workflow driven by our strong presence in the Dako investment automation and also the down flow interpretation piece now with Cartagenia. And then on top, we want to build the individual applications. This is not finalizing one element before going into the next wave. We are already operating in them, but you can say, where our key focus right now is to go out and accelerate Omnis and get the workflow up and running. And this will in the end drive the workflow towards and the whole version towards getting to the pathology division and to the diagnostic cockpit that we believe is going to be instrumental. And we believe this is a key differentiator in the laboratories going forward. The whole architecture can, will, then be moved into other labs also and that\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely also ambition.
While we execute on that strategy, we also move ourselves up to an attractive operating margin again. And we are doing that really by, of course, leveraging our top line opportunities with Omnis, the CDx opportunity with PD-L1 and other and also starting to commercialize genomics workflows. At the same time, we will continue to operate and improve our cost structure. As Mike also alluded to under the agile Agilent activities, we have full focus on the Dako integration, really have to say to streamline the infrastructure to improve commercialization and now also being able to deliver and provide our genomics toolset through the pathology channel and vice versa. And I think this is a great opportunity, both from a cost perspective, but furthermore, from business perspective, that we now have full opportunity to do everything we want from a commercial end.
We are coming back after the FDA warning that has been cleared out. We will go back into normal operations that will also lower some costs. We will, however, continue to invest in the higher compliance level going forward, but that\xe2\x80\x99s clear that we can also lower the overall cost space based on that. And Henrik will now also talk about how we will continue, of course, to improve our gross margin. This will bring us to 20% operating profit in \xe2\x80\x9817 and I also will drive that beyond, but first and foremost, focus on the \xe2\x80\x9817 goal of 20% operating margin. So, all of that rounds me off by saying that we will, over the next period of time, our key focus is to accelerate the Omnis placement. We will go out and commercialize our CDx assays. And we will build out our workflows in the genomic space. And finally, leverage out great capabilities diagnostics space understanding on how to do diagnostics into also the genomics and the mass spec business and that will drive the overall growth in attractive space and also the operating profit back to where we need to be.
And with that, I will leave it over to Henrik Ancher-Jensen, who will give you all the excitement of the OFS.
Henrik Ancher-Jensen
Thank you very much, Jacob. And now to something completely different, the only thing that will remain in the next 15, 20 minutes is the beautiful accent. I think that to go into this one here, you have heard a lot about, a lot of growth strategies in a lot of places. For us to be able to deliver on that, we need to have a solid backbone in the company that is our order fulfillment and supply chain organization that needs to be able to deliver this. To do so, we have created a new model of how to operate. I will get you a little closer to that. And we have also created a promise to our internal people and to our external people, that we will deliver $75 million from savings over the next three years. In order to do that, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to have a plan. So, we will talk about that. And not only do we need to have a plan, you also need to have sort of a framework in which you intent to execute that plan. So, that is a chance you will actually reach a goal.
What I will tell you right out of the gate here is that the key takeaways from this presentation, is that we are committed to deliver the $75 million. We have a very good foundation from 2014 as you will see at the end and we are on good track to meeting our \xe2\x80\x9815 numbers as well. Meaning that we will stay the course for the OFS organization to deliver what we are supposed to deliver for the new One Agilent to get to where we need to be. So, the plan we need to have to get to here is that we have created a new strategy in operation that we have named the Power of One. First of all, because it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to remember; secondly, because it makes sense, because one of the wants is that we have to make sure that we act as one company at all times, both externally and internally. You will see that in the new operating model that we will go into in a little bit.
We need to make sure that we are the number one company when it comes to quality and delivery performance. You have heard both Patrick and Jacob and Mark talk about how important it is to the customers we serve that we are very, very high on the quality scale, and obviously, customers need what they need when they ask for it. And the $75 million will be OFS\xe2\x80\x99 contribution to driving to the 1% operating margin improvement. And we will get into a couple of examples a little bit later on exactly how we are going to do so. So \xe2\x80\x93 but as I mentioned, it is a good idea to have a framework you can execute all this stuff. And so what we have done the last 14 months or 10 months, I should say, is we have developed a global framework starting with the Power of One elements as the guiding lights. We have broken down a strategic plan in every single center of excellence we have on every single operational site, every single process area. We have been building a plan that year-over-year ensures that we get to where we need to be.
On top of that, since you all know, trust is good and control is a lot better. We have instituted a global execution board and instituted what we believe are all the right tools, so we can track all these activities month-over-month and immediately see if anything is off-track so we can put in mitigating actions. So, we will not get surprised by anything very much running by the mantra that bad news early is good news, because it gives us an opportunity to make sure that we are always on track.
So, to execute this framework, we have built the new operating model. And the operating model here is both a way of aligning the way we see how we operate, but we have also changed the underlying organization to reflect this structure. So, quite a bit of reorganization have taken place the last 10 months to bring us where we are today. The key in the operating model are the three centers of excellences in the middle, where the instrument manufacturing group takes care of all discrete manufacturing in the company around the globe. This gives us the opportunity to leverage both manufacturing technologies and engineering capabilities across the globe in all our discrete business.
The chemistries in the middle is our process business for chemistries and consumables and our bio-reagents primarily support our bio-reagents and our genetics business. The reason for these two process areas to be separate and not be consolidated into one is that the one area is highly regulated under FDA and VISA, etcetera, etcetera and the other one is that. So, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to mix those two things together. However, the two work really, really close together, because there is a lot of leverage between how those two manufacturing setups are running. Some of the achievements that we have done while we reorganized this just to give you a feel for that, is that on the instruments side, we have closed down at the end of Q2 two manufacturing sites or consolidated two manufacturing sites.
We will have consolidated a non-manufacturing site in this area at the end of Q4. We have consolidated one manufacturing site on our chemistries. And our bio-reagents has been very working very hard on what Jacob alluded to before about getting a much, much closer integration also on the manufacturing and supply chain side between the Dako business and the Agilent business, so lots of stuff going on in those areas. On top of it, we have consolidated our global supply chain and our logistics group into one set, which has allowed us to go after one global logistics model. We have already improved our logistics network quite a bit and ensure that we continue to have the absolutely best freight rates out there. The bottom of this one here is the levers that the different centers of excellences can use to drive more value. We realized when we started working with this that these centers would be even better if they had some global process areas to pull from.
So, what we did was and we put out groups, starting over with the business solution, which is our business application groups that secure the task here to make sure that our entire global manufacturing and supply chain utilizes all our ERP systems and all our IT solutions the optimal way so that we actually get back \xe2\x80\x93 bang for the buck for all the investment we made there. We have a continuous improvement group that has been completely revived. Agilent have always had a lot of continuous improvement around the world, but we realized that if you look at the different manufacturing sites and logistical centers, the level was very, very different. So, there is an awful lot of gains we have by leveraging best practices around this around the world.
Also, when it comes to new product introduction, I think it would be fair to say that we are fairly good at product introductions in general. However, there are certain parts of the company that are really good. And we believe that by taking all these practices on how do you introduce new products into these centers of excellences and optimize them, we will not only be able to get faster to market, but we will launch better quality products overall, because we will be able to secure a much higher design for X once we get to the market release.
Last but not least, we have our global value engineering group. And to dig a little bit more into that, when we talk about value engineering in Agilent, basically we talk about what happens to the instrument or the product after that\xe2\x80\x99s been released, so the post-market exercise. That is a primary thing. So, basically any kind of change you can make to the product that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a significant change to \xe2\x80\x93 with the function, that\xe2\x80\x99s a junk.
The other part we use this group for is as an internal outsourcing partner for Jacob and Patrick and Mark and the organizations. So, if they need \xe2\x80\x93 if they see the need for lower cost engineering capabilities out of Penang, as an example, we do that in this group as well. However, the way we have set it up here is that this group is centered out of our global engineering center in Penang. We realized very quickly that we also do value engineering in every single factory around the world, but they were very much acting as standalone units. So, what we have done is we have connected all of them into one global collaborative setup so that we at all times know exactly what value engineering activity goes on where. And even more importantly, we can proactively start planning where should they take place before they start? So, we make sure we utilize our capabilities and competencies the right way across the world when we move for this. And it goes without saying that the intent of this, of course, is to make sure that we make money and that we extend our product lifecycle the best we can.
I have taken an example in here to give you a little feel for some of the things that comes out of it. As you probably have heard previously, we have spent quite a bit of time over the last couple of years to do different \xe2\x80\x93 move our product lines, etcetera. And once that has been done successfully, what they need to do is we need to move the supply chain, your supply base. So, one of the initiatives we have for this year is that we are moving a very significant part of our suppliers from where they used to be into low cost regions. And this initiative alone, well, in 2015, generated $10 million savings, just as one initiative out of what we have going on. So, that is the \xe2\x80\x93 that is part of what we do in value engineering.
At the end of this, just to repeat, I think we are in an excellent position to support the growth that Patrick and Jacob and Mark are going to bring in. I think that we are in a very good position to drive not only the cost savings we have promised, but additional operational excellence and we will be delivering the $75 million over the next three years. So, on that happy note, I think it is time for Q&A exercise with Jacob, Mark, Patrick and myself.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - Steve Beuchaw
Hi, thanks for taking the questions. It\xe2\x80\x99s Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Jacob, I will start with you. Well, first off, thanks for the presentation with what was really a spectacular accent. I did enjoy that.
A - Jacob Thaysen
Thank you.
Q - Steve Beuchaw
On the questions though, I guess first off, today relative to 12 months ago, what\xe2\x80\x99s really new with Dako that gives you confidence that you can drive more share in that business? Is that the resolution of the warning letter? Is it something about integration? Is it software? What do you see that gives you confidence that you can grow that business above the rate of the market? My second question for you is on the broader pathology offering, it\xe2\x80\x99s really a market structure question. There are obviously other players who want to win there as well who have sequencers, who have relatively near-term offerings in clinical mass specs. What do you think are your points of leverage that will allow you to win against other very well-capitalized, very smart competitors in the pathology lab more broadly? And then a question on the mass spec offerings for \xe2\x80\x93 well, frankly, for anyone on the team, where you think the low hanging fruit is for market share capture over the next year or two? As you have come through a strategic review with Mike at the helm and you have an opportunity to refocus your commercial and product development resources, where do you think you gain share in the nearer term? Thanks.
A - Jacob Thaysen
Alright. So, maybe I should start if I remember all the questions here, but first, I will address the questions around why we believe that we can take market share in \xe2\x80\x93 with advanced staining where Dako has historically been very, very strong. Clearly, having \xe2\x80\x93 getting an FDA warning letter will give you somewhat of an internal focus to clear that out, but at the same time, we have been developing the Omnis platform. And really, in the game we are right now with our competitors being Ventana and Leica, this is about providing solutions out there. And we want \xe2\x80\x93 we have with the best and highest quality operating portfolio and now also with an instrumentation solution and the software that where we have really been out and developing this together with the customer. And the feedback we get from the customers is that this first and foremost is the most ease-of-use instrument out there, solution out there. It\xe2\x80\x99s with the one with the highest capacity and also with the highest best turnaround time. It is absolutely a key differentiator in the market. And we do believe that, that in and itself will go out and we can see that will drive market share. So, that is really looking at, you can say, the head-to-head game we have right now with the two others.
Then to address the opportunity on the broader perspective of driving the pathology division and thereby also driving the other workflows into the laboratory, I think that \xe2\x80\x93 I mean, clearly, you are right, I mean, if you look into our competitors, both being Thermo and Illumina and others that they already have sequencing solutions out there, clearly, I see them actually as right now more as enablers. We have been out seeing that there is a lot of sequences come out there, but the true challenge is we need to \xe2\x80\x93 first and foremost, we need to understand the laboratory. There is not enough to understand how we do sequences, but you need to have a relationship with the pathologist, understand what their pain points is and understand \xe2\x80\x93 well, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to do sequencing or anything, you need to really augment that with what the test they do today to give them that additional information they need to make the right decisions and we sit with those capabilities. At the same time, we already have a strong presence with our target investments and now also with a very, very capable interpretation platform that we can really build our workflows around that. It goes without saying I would love to have a sequence in the portfolio also. We will, over the \xe2\x80\x93 going forward, also see how we can collaborate. Can we OEM? Can we get access to one or the other? I am not sure we got into a leveraged acquisition right now, one of the big ones right now, but absolutely, we want to go out and go for that also. I think those were the two questions from my end.
A - Patrick Kaltenbach
So, let me briefly capture the question about mass spec and the mass spec markets. Clearly, the mass spec tools are the fastest growing segment in the analytical tools market, I mean, beyond anything else out there. And this is true for LC-MS as well as GCMS or even ICP-MS. In many of these platforms we have today already a very strong market footprint if you look at GCMS and ICP. On LC-MS, we still have room to capture share. What we did as an organization is we really restructured the organization with one strong mass spec organization, which is now set up to really push our platform stronger in the market and also capture more share with new innovative solution. So, I really encourage you to watch out on to the GCMS. Later this week, we will launch new products there as well. And the growth we have seen over the last couple of quarters, as I mentioned in my talk, especially in the LC-MS domain was clearly above the market. And we \xe2\x80\x93 I am sure we can continue to drive this momentum. There is, as I said, plenty of room for us to grow, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in pharma/biopharma or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in applied markets, where these tools are heavily used. I think as with our reputation we have both on the Triple Quad as well as on the Q-TOF platform, we are well-positioned to capture more growth.
A - Mark Doak
And just a little bit of perspective, I guess too in context of talking about rationalization, looking forward across the company, I think we\xe2\x80\x99d share that informatics and software is going to increasingly become part of the landscape as witnessed by Cartagenia and others. It\xe2\x80\x99s really about what can you do with the information across disparate sources? And I will also say just the move towards the biological sampling and how much resource we put behind that is going to be an area where we rationalize going forward. Good question, though. Another?
Q - Tycho Peterson
Can I just follow up on that? On the biologics, can you maybe just talk about how you feel you are positioned competitively? Obviously, we just saw Danaher build out with bioprocesses with the Pall acquisition. Thermo has got a good business in bioprocess as well. Do you need to be investing more there? How do you feel like you are positioned?
A - Mark Doak
Well, do you want to start, Patrick?
A - Patrick Kaltenbach
I can start with it. I mean, what we see is the move from new chemical entities to new biological entities switches also the demand in terms of analytical tools behind that. And there is definitely growth opportunity for us. If you look at bio compared with LC, if you look at special solutions on the LC-MS side, including software solutions to help to identify or to confirm, for example, biosimilars, we have a strong footprint in that area as well and we continue to also work closely with our customers to look at their needs in the new workflows, especially specifically in the biopharma space.
A - Mark Doak
And I\xe2\x80\x99d add to that. I think there is still a lot of opportunity to go in the context of what we can do to further support that movement towards that from a consumables and chemistries point of view and also just in general building the talent inside the company that\xe2\x80\x99s clearly a goal that we will bring more in that area.
Q - Tycho Peterson
And then just a quick follow-up for Jacob, on the 600 basis point margin improvement in two years, can you maybe just talk about other big swing factors? I mean, you talked about still being compliance obviously you still have costs there, what are the big swing factors to get that margin in the next two years?
A - Jacob Thaysen
So, just to understand the question, Tycho, you asked what are the big swing factors for bringing ourselves to 20%? Yes, I think there are \xe2\x80\x93 I mean, there are the two main part on the cost structure. First of all, getting beyond now the FDA warning letter, which will definitely drive out some cost and now also integrating the Dako businesses which will also take out cost of that element. At the same time, we do expect that we will seek improved growth in our pathology business and others, where we have been struggling, of course, also due to the FDA and now getting the full Omnis that will take off better on a great growth trajectory and at the same time the CDx business that will see the PD-L1 start to help us on the growth side also. So, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s really two bases just first of all, be mindful about the cost and take out cost both from the FDA and from the Dako integration and then see some improved in our growth rates from our legacy businesses also.
Q - Steve Willoughby
In the back here, Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Two questions. First, for Mark, on the CrossLab business, is the growth that you expect in that business, is it more of market growth or is it also dependent upon share gains? I guess also could you just explain kind of why Agilent wins in that business versus your two other competitors there? And then on the spectroscopy side, you talked about some good share gains in the ICP-MS, can you kind of talk about what the future looks like for that in terms of both opportunity to continue to gain share and what \xe2\x80\x93 maybe any revenue ramifications it might have?
A - Mark Doak
So, on the CrossLab question, first of all, we are seeing market share gains, we are capturing share from competitors. And secondly, just in the broader context of our own growth, our potential and our connect rates continue to rise for many reasons. The products, but also the channel we have in place was actually well matched to the buying of our customers and enterprise sales team and enterprise deployment team around services, all the way down to a transaction phase. So, we see that across the board. I come back to kind of against the competition. First of all, our bringing together all these capabilities, software, chemistries, supplies and services that is unique in the sense that we are leveraging all those across that and trying to deliver the integrated solutions. I think when you look at the differentiation components of this too it\xe2\x80\x99s back to our core competencies I have mentioned. We actually started a big investment in R&D in 2004 around services and remote diagnostics monitoring, the backbone of what we can do in terms of looking at the asset utilization. And that investment frankly has paid off quite well. So, I think we compete well across all those dimensions and it\xe2\x80\x99s both the breadth, the technical depth and ultimately the degree that we can actually provide that degree of insight to the customer I talked about.
A - Patrick Kaltenbach
Alright and let me briefly comment on the ICP-MS question. I can only tell you that March is not over. I mean, the growth we have seen specifically behind the ICP-OES system, I mentioned the 7% market share gain over the last year is we still see very strong incoming order pattern. And part of it is of course also replacing some of the weaker platforms that are out there for this traditional ICP-MS systems as well, because this system is not only best in class when it comes to throughput, stability, robustness, but also the sensitivity level of this new ICP-OES system now captures some of the markets that traditional ICP-MS captured in several application domains. And our own ICP-MS platform also continuously delivers growth. So, forward-looking, I would say the margin spectroscopy is not all what we certainly have still have room to grow in terms of market share. We are by \xe2\x80\x93 be a market leader, but it is still a good percentage of market we can capture over the next couple of years.
Q - Unidentified Analyst
Thank you, guys for being here and providing so much information. We appreciate it. Just a question for Mark on the ACG business, what is the specific capture rate that you guys have and how does that compare to you competitors?
A - Mark Doak
It\xe2\x80\x99s a number that\xe2\x80\x99s widely debated, but little known in terms of how much that really might mean. So, I can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x93 frankly, I can\xe2\x80\x99t really comment in the context of exact numbers. What I can say is we believe we are leaders in certain areas just based on what we see in overall dollars spent, but how that\xe2\x80\x99s defined and how you get that data, it\xe2\x80\x99s much more difficult than finding it inside of a traditional end market or even an instrument spend. Does that answer your question?
Q - Unidentified Analyst
Not really. Can you comment on whether it\xe2\x80\x99s....
A - Mark Doak
Well, by the way I think we are very competitive in all of the areas, but exact numbers are really hard to come by.
Q - Unidentified Analyst
Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s higher or lower than the two competitors you outlined, Perkin and Thermo?
A - Mark Doak
I would say in the \xe2\x80\x93 certainly in certain areas associated with our portfolio in consumables, we have in the columns positions, a leading position and in certainly in the areas of services, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say from an apples-to-apples point of view. But if you just look at the fundamental size of our business, we are clearly larger than PerkinElmer. And Thermo is hard to get at, too, but I think we find a real larger business in that area too.
Q - Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And do you make more margin when you attach to your products versus your competitors\xe2\x80\x99 products, can you comment on that mix?
A - Mark Doak
Yes, we do although the \xe2\x80\x93 because we have so much of the Agilent install base inside of the marketplace, it\xe2\x80\x99s usually \xe2\x80\x93 almost all of our positions in terms of our engagements start with an Agilent \xe2\x80\x93 strong Agilent base.
Q - Derik De Bruin
Hi, Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. So, a couple of questions. I guess first off, I know there has been some commentary about our pharma replacement cycle and sort of pickup there. I guess, could you sort of give some comment on what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in terms of implementation in the pharma market? And then a completely different tact, which is going to be installed base of the Omnis platform where you are penetrated in terms of replacements, I am just sort of like how do we think about the roadmap of that and then the market opportunity for those products in China and staining in general in China?
A - Patrick Kaltenbach
Okay. I think I will take the first one on pharma, if okay. So, on the pharma is basically right, but we have seen larger replacement cycles of yields and I think that, that cycle isn\xe2\x80\x99t over. What we have given our customers is really an incentive to move from the older platforms to the new platforms with, for example, the new Infinity II series, which has full backwards compatibility to our own instrumentation, but also allows easy method transfer from our vendor solutions on to our LC systems. So, it makes the transition for customers much easier to transfer from standard HPLC to what I would call a 100% compatible UHPLC system, which the Infinity II system is. So, forward-looking, I still think there is a lot of opportunity for us in pharma to take more of these replacement ways.
A - Jacob Thaysen
So, on the installed base side, I mean, we \xe2\x80\x93 right now, we have not communicated the individual number, but I can say that the overall placements of instruments we do right now combined between Omnis and the old Autostainer is increasing. So we still place the old Autostainers also in the market for specific segments. And we do see as I also have told before, that the cycles within this business is around 5 years, so we cannot penetrate all customers at once. But you kind of have only accessible to around a year \xe2\x80\x93 20% per year. And the total market of installations is around 6,000, 7,000, so you can do your own math to see how many installations you can do to take the whole market per year. But I can tell you we right now see the overall growth and we see of course that this is driven by the Omnis installation. We \xe2\x80\x93 key focus was the first year on Europe and euro \xe2\x80\x93 Europe and U.S., but we have also a good footprint now into both China, Japan and other places in the Far East.
Q - Tim Evans
It\xe2\x80\x99s Tim Evans, Wells Fargo Securities. I wanted to ask a question about the sequencing workflow, 2 years or 3 years ago at this meeting, it was pretty clear your position was that you were happy kind of in the sample prep area, now we have seen you kind of build out more on the data analytics and several competitors have also made moves to kind of consolidate that sequencing workflow, do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to own the box in the middle, what is your view on that and if so how might you go about doing that?

So, I mean what we believe is important is first of all you need to understand your customer. You need to understand, you cannot just say everybody needs sequencing. It\xe2\x80\x99s an effective lab, what they need out there, cytogenetics lab needs a lot of information on cancer lab that in the end maybe only need 20, maybe 15 \xe2\x80\x93 50 mutations. And also, how it looks into the workflow, how does that give more information to the pathologist or to the clinicians in the end. So where we see the big bottlenecks today, I mean you can see in the research in clinical research space that you have the capabilities, you have the competencies to address difficult workflows, both upfront in the sample prep area, but also in the downstream in the mutation area. In order to fully penetrate into what we believe is the next wave also in the community laboratories, the small laboratories you need to have a much more simple approach to this.
The good thing is that we see already sequences in many of those laboratories, so now we see laboratories looking for partners that can combine all of this into real components into workflows, simplify the upstream also and simplify the downstream. And that\xe2\x80\x99s where we play. What I would say I do not like a sequencing \xe2\x80\x93 I will absolutely love that to have a full portfolio, but I do believe that with the footprint of sequences out there, we actually have a very, very relevant play to do also without a box.
Q - Tim Evans
So we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily expect to see an Agilent sequencer out there in 2 years or 3 years?
A - Jacob Thaysen
Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s always difficult to tell you about our portfolio internally. But we \xe2\x80\x93 I can tell you, we all the time are looking into alternatives to see how we can close our gaps in our portfolio, including the sequencing.
Q - Dane Leone
Okay. So this is Dane from BTIG. So I guess two questions for Jacob. One, when you think about the growth for DGG over the next several years, how much of that is predicated on increasing exposure to emerging markets, if we think about some of the more traditional diagnostic areas, developed markets have a little bit more of a deflationary spend in terms of overall pricing versus better volume gains and in emerging markets. So just kind of if you could lay out kind of a strategy as you see it there for the next several years. And the second question would be, is \xe2\x80\x93 from your commentary, is there \xe2\x80\x93 is your point of view that ultimately you are going to be able to bundle some of the analytical solutions more on the genomic side with some of the traditional anatomic paths \xe2\x80\x93 path products in the Dako channel versus how we see things today where most of the analysis is done more on a genomics core versus a path lab, so maybe a longer-term view there will be helpful?
A - Jacob Thaysen
Yes. I mean, we have started the \xe2\x80\x93 and the last question here \xe2\x80\x93 the final question here around whether we see that we would see genomics tools go into the pathology, both the laboratories and they have also a commercial arm in there and also whether we start to see some of the LC/MS emerging tools here going into our sales force. And the short answer is, yes I do believe that what you will see going forward, you are absolutely right. Right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s the bigger labs, the big labs that do the sequencing. And then you can say laboratories outsource their test tools rather than performing the \xe2\x80\x93 in the bigger labs and then you get the results back. This has been the same \xe2\x80\x93 that actually was the same kind of setup you had with IHC and also FISH historically. And it\xe2\x80\x99s all about a reimbursement versus cost exercise the individual labs have to do. So when the volume becomes attractive enough, you start to in-source that. But you also need to have those capabilities to in-source that.
So you will see over time that when volume increase in those laboratories, you will see that they \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s more \xe2\x80\x93 become more and more attractive to in-source the whole workflow and those all can build into the laboratory. And that\xe2\x80\x99s where you see you need to have those capabilities to really support those customers because they are certainly more the community hospice and pathologists and do not maybe have the \xe2\x80\x93 all the intelligence and \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong word all the capabilities. Thank you. Thanks a lot [indiscernible] my accent and my narrations in the beginning here. But yes, then you need to bring out those capabilities to help them in those laboratories. So that has been one, so yes that we definitely believe that will happen. Where do we see the growth coming going forward and where do we see price pressure and so on, I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s in the \xe2\x80\x93 just the pathology space itself, advanced staining space itself, in the mature markets, it\xe2\x80\x99s still a very attractive growth opportunity.
We have seen some ups and downs in the last few years due to some changes in reimbursement and so on. But generally speaking, the underlying volume sits around 7%, 8%, at least growth opportunity. And then depending a little bit was the price pressure here or not. The overall growth of that market sits between 6% and 8%. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t see right now over the next period of time that, that will change substantially. Then you have the opportunities in the emerging markets, particularly China is an opportunity that we are investing in both from pathology but also in genomics. It really requires to truly penetrate China to have a very, very good understanding on the regulatory aspects here because they are much more hard coming down on the regulatory requirements. For example, U.S., we are in the advanced inning area, you might have a handful of Class 3 devices. Then in China, it\xe2\x80\x99s small, 500 of the Class 3 devices. So you need to have a completely different strategy to clinical studies and so on. So that\xe2\x80\x99s an area, but that\xe2\x80\x99s also more investment that needs to go in which plays to offer. Was that all the questions?
Q - Isaac Ro
Hi, Isaac Ro from Goldman. Thanks. Just, Mark want to come back to the commentary you had on the CrossLab, but I think you have touched on it a little bit earlier in another question, last 4 years you grew that business like 11%, I think you said in the slide and your guidance calls for 5% or 6%. But it seems like a lot of the ingredients were there for the market to continue growing in a pretty good pace, so I just want to understand what your underlying assumptions are for the growth rate of that market versus what you expect to grow, I am assuming 5% or 6% implies some level of market share gain. But again, if the business grew 11% trailing 5 years or 4 years, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like the setup would be for it to decelerate that significantly, so I just want to understand your assumptions a little better?
A - Mark Doak
We will go back to my first comment, which is our track record of growth is actually -- in the past I would view the answering the question though, if you look at the market rate growth and the assumptions we made that it would grow at 4%, that the \xe2\x80\x93 slightly faster in the context of what we are going to do with Agilent, guiding towards 5% or 6% where we are probably still a couple of points over the overall growth rate. I think the other thing is the law of big numbers. We are now at $1.3 billion, so hitting a high single-digit growth rate in that. But from the market dynamics, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see a fundamental change in terms of what I would expect for the growth in these businesses, though.
Q - Isaac Ro
Okay, great. And then Patrick maybe a question for the LC/MS conversation, so I think it\xe2\x80\x99s on your slides, you guys have had a pretty good run on gaining share, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely clear to me the exact path to continuing that process, it seems like there was a little bit to do with integrating workflows, maybe a couple of specific verticals, but maybe if you can just recap exactly how you expect to gain share in LC/MS just given where you have been, that would be helpful?
A - Patrick Kaltenbach
Yes. So again, the reason why I think we can gain share in LC/MS is the R&D probably and the output behind the platform is again the combined platform, bringing out new solutions. The second piece you highlighted yourself is the total workflows to be addressed. And a good example is \xe2\x80\x93 is for example what we launched 2 years ago, which now has a lot of traction also in the biopharma space, which is our AssayMAP solution, combination of our automation capabilities together with our mass spec capabilities is really driving rather nice growth on the MS side. Then Triple Quad is \xe2\x80\x93 has been historically strong for us in LC/MS, and it continues to be strong. I think where the battle right now is going out there. On the out is what\xe2\x80\x99s happening around the QTOF. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s all about \xe2\x80\x93 a bit more positioning question about the QTOF on positioning that more aggressively against some of our competitors\xe2\x80\x99 platforms. And you will see us also in terms of messaging around the platform differently in the future because especially when you look at fast chromatography, combining the mass spec, QTOF has an inherent advantage in the combination with fast chromatography, because this is where it really comes to the high resolution and high dynamic range that the Q-TOF can come into play.
A - Mark Doak
Yes. I wanted to make sure I followed that up with one question. You talked about that double-digit \xe2\x80\x93 the 11% growth included therein. So, if you back it down to more recent years in \xe2\x80\x9814, 7%, so that data point was important. I want to make sure I get that across.
A - Patrick Kaltenbach
I think we have another question here. Yes.
A - Mark Doak
Another question up here?
Q - Miroslava Minkova
Good afternoon. Miroslava Minkova with Stifel. Maybe a question on the Diagnostics and Genomics, one of the comments that you just made that the pathology markets themselves are growing at the 6% to 8% or 6% to 7% and yet you are targeting 6% to 7% for the next few years given that you do also have the faster growing genomics business that seems perhaps a little bit conservative for the outer years. Maybe help us understand your thinking about the growth trajectory of that business?
A - Jacob Thaysen
Yes, a good question. I mean, what we presented in the final slides was the DGG, which also encompasses bigger. We have the portfolio that also addresses the research market. Today, what I talked about was the opportunity within the clinical research and diagnostics, but a big part of our portfolio also addresses a lower growth rate. So, that blended is putting us into this. So, you would \xe2\x80\x93 you should expect us to see higher growth drivers into our clinical research expectation that\xe2\x80\x99s what we presented.
Q - Miroslava Minkova
Okay, thank you for that. And when do you expect the PD-L1 collaboration with Merck to perhaps pan out? Is there anything baked into your guidance for companion diagnostics products for the next few years?
A - Jacob Thaysen
So, we \xe2\x80\x93 I mean, first of all, the PD-L1 opportunity is big, but fragmented meaning that there is a lot of pharma companies out there that works on it. We work with several of them, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also based on individual products actually. So, each pharma company has their own also target and thereby own antibodies. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be little bit interesting to see how all that plays out, but the overall opportunity is substantial. Right now, we have not put guidance on it, but I can tell you the good drivers there are the good \xe2\x80\x93 what you say, comparables are the ALK companion diagnostic, which is around $25 million and you have the HER2, which is mainly around $100 million. I believe that PD-L1 will be in that ballgame. I cannot say whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in high end or low end right now. When we will come out with it, I cannot tell you the exact \xe2\x80\x93 we cannot communicate the exact commercialization date right now, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen over next six months.
Q - Miroslava Minkova
Thank you.
A - Mike McMullen
Alright, thank you very much.
A - Jacob Thaysen
Thank you.
A - Henrik Ancher-Jensen
Thank you.
End of Q&A
Mike McMullen
Well, am I coming through okay now? So, thanks, Alicia, for keeping us on time. Before I close off, I would like to take one final look inside of Agilent to have you get a sense of how we are thinking about the business and what we are trying to do. What I want to describe for you now is how we are constantly challenging ourselves to think about where the markets are going and to place early bets so that we could have new commercial opportunities for Agilent down the road. By the way, full disclosure, I am not signing up for any more growth, but I just want to give you a sense of how we are thinking about positioning the company for growth down the road.
What we are asking ourselves, what I am constantly challenging my team is, are we changing as fast as the world around us is changing? I have been in business for a little over 30 years. And one of the things I have seen, particularly in larger companies, is they move too slow. They don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate where markets are going. They find themselves reacting, responding and really get left behind. I think you know countless examples of that where companies get out-innovated and beat in the marketplace. So we\xe2\x80\x99re constantly challenging ourselves and say, are we moving fast enough? Are we out in front of the change? We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in a position of reacting.
Just kind of give you a sense of how we are thinking about this opportunity within the company and we are thinking about some very specific opportunities, for example, synthetic biology, creating or modifying new genes. By the way, this capability exists today in Agilent with our oligo writers to come up with new organisms to develop new sources of fuel materials, medicine. We have bio-reagent. We have measurement portfolio. We have thought leader collaborations going on with the Wyss Institute here on the East Coast at Harvard, Synthetic Biology Institute with UC Berkeley in California, where are these markets going placing early bets, so they can become commercial successes for us. We talked about precision medicine making sure the medicine that you are given actually works for you. And Jacob just talked about the exciting place we have in companion diagnostics, not yet in our guidance, but we have relationships with nine of the leading pharma companies around the world. We are number one in advanced staining in terms of the companion diagnostics and more announcements to be coming.
We talked about the \xe2\x80\x93 what we believe this can be this strong growth, I think this is shared across the industry. You have sequencing moves into the clinic. We have already talked about how we are providing \xe2\x80\x93 going down the path providing workflow solutions with both on the front end with our sample prep capabilities, but on the back end with the recently announced Cartagenia acquisition. And then the terminology we use within \xe2\x80\x93 that we have coined within Agilent for ourselves is integrated biology pulling together disparate sciences of genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, all to better understand and fully characterize the functions of cells tied together with the integrated software. So, again, these are \xe2\x80\x93 this is the hallmark of a new Agilent to be thinking about where markets are going to be able to put early bets, so we can eventually turn these into larger commercial opportunities for the company and again not committing to more growth, but I wanted to give you some view of how we are thinking about positioning the company for the long-term in terms of growth prospects.
When I started off, I talked about what drives the Agilent team, if I got a whole team aligned in terms of the next frontiers of growth, making the world a safer place, finding ways to develop and bring to market new types of resources and helping fight diseases, we are going to be a company that\xe2\x80\x99s going to do very well while doing good. So this is exciting vision for us. I just want to give you a sense of we are pushing our teams to really be focused on these next frontiers of growth and placing bets to make sure we can turn those into commercial opportunities for our shareholders.
I want to thank you for the \xe2\x80\x93 we covered a lot of material today and we heard a number of speakers saw a number of slides. And I really do appreciate your time today in creating engaging questions, really an opportunity for us to have a dialogue with you today about the new Agilent. So, as you walk out the door and have your 60 some pages of slides in your hand, I would ask you to remember just a few things. First of all, the new formula that Agilent has for catalyzing shareholder value for our customers \xe2\x80\x93 I mean, for our investors. Well, the new Agilent is increasingly in tune with our customers and investors. We will build premier market positions and you just heard from each of the group presidents how we are going to do that. As I listen to the questions, a lot of the probing questions were, geez, can\xe2\x80\x99t you do more than that? So, I think you can see we are serious and have real plans to build premium market positions in our chosen markets. So, there is also a message today around focus.
What that will do is translate into my three pillars, premier shareholder value creation, which is the accelerated organic growth, expand operating margins and the optimal capital allocation given \xe2\x80\x93 driven by a high cash generation. So again, that\xe2\x80\x99s the formula. These are the commitments. The new Agilent is all about increasing and sustain value creation; organic growth, 5% versus an assumed market growth of 4%, with the appetite to do more; driving operating margins to historic high levels of 22% again with an appetite to be able to do more; and increasing our capital returns to shareholders with a new commitment to return over 85% of free cash flow to our shareholders.
So, again, I want to thank you for coming out today. It\xe2\x80\x99s been my real pleasure to be a new CEO to have an opportunity to present to you so early in my tenure with Agilent in terms of my new role. We have an aligned, collaborative business team ready to go and deliver on the commitments you have heard us make in today\xe2\x80\x99s Investor and Analyst Meeting. So again, thank you for coming out. And I think we will close off the meeting.
