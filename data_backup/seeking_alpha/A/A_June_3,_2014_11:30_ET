Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
Welcome to the Jefferies 2014 Global Healthcare Conference. My name is Brandon Couillard, senior life science tools and diagnostics analyst here at Jefferies. Very happy to have Agilent with us back at the conference this year and joining us on behalf of the company, Head of \xe2\x80\x93 President of the Chemical Analysis Group, Mr. Mike McMullen. Mike?
Mike McMullen
Thank you, Brandon. And it\xe2\x80\x99s real pleasure to be here and thank you for all for joining us today. The format today is a fireside chat. We will go into a Q&A here in a few minutes, but I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d just maybe open up with a few comments about Agilent\xe2\x80\x99s recently completed second quarter and also give you an update on a major event within Agilent, which is the separation of Agilent into two pure-play companies, one focused on our electronic measurement business, we will form a new independent company, Keysight Technologies. And then as a result, we will have a new Agilent Technologies a company focused 100% on our life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical analysis markets.
So, I will give you an update on both topics here in a second. So, relative to the second quarter, as you may recall, we had in line performance in terms of revenue and bottom line profitability meeting the commitments we have communicated to you. And through the quarter, we saw very strong order performance and both businesses, the electronic measurement business as well as our life sciences, diagnostics, and chemical analysis businesses are well positioned for the third quarter as we ended up with our book-to-bill at a company level of 1.05. So, orders came in than revenue and shipments were recognized in Q2. So a very strong close to the quarter for us with in line performance on the top line and bottom line.
I mentioned to you earlier that we are in the midst of a major event for the company, which is the separation of the company into two pure-play companies. So, let me just give you an update on where we are? So, we are on track for what looks to be an early November separation, where Keysight will operate as independent company, but a major milestone is you should be keeping an eye on, is in early August, we expect that Keysight Technologies again our former electronic measurement business will operate as the independently owned subsidiary come early August, which will be our fiscal Q4.
I thought I will also share with you the overall summary here, which is the separation work is going extremely well and our employees are very excited about the work in front of them and the anticipation of what\xe2\x80\x99s in front of us, which is to create two great companies from one.
So, with that, I will open it up to questions with I guess Brandon you are facilitating.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
Super. Mike, I promise you this will be the only question I ask you on Keysight, but just fundamentally, is there some reason that the spin cannot happen before November with the Keysight being effectively operationally 100% independent in August?
Mike McMullen
Yes, a great question. So, first of all, obviously there is lots of work that\xe2\x80\x99s required to split the company in terms of getting the legal approvals, un-tangling all the IT systems working through the separation of the real estate and that is going fairly well and should be online for early August. But the fundamental reason why we are not going early is really to have Keysight get kind of one quarter under the belt operating as an independent company, but still under the umbrella of Agilent. So, we really want to have that one quarter performance and kind of working through as an independent company albeit under the umbrella of Agilent. So, we want to give Ron and team a quarter to get that under that experience under the belt before becoming an independent company.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
And then in terms of the second quarter performance, I think the margin experience for LDA is pretty well documented, but the guidance for the year implies a pretty substantial ramp in the fourth quarter? What are the drivers to that back end loaded dynamic and what gives you the confidence in terms of the sequential or implied sequential ramp from 3Q to 4Q?
Mike McMullen
Yes, sure. So, I think I would point to two things. One is the proverbial volume, right, so our story in Q2 was the operating margins weren\xe2\x80\x99t in our expectations, because the revenues came in below our expectations, albeit in line with the overall commitments for the company. So, the message we communicated in our second quarter was that we saw the environment particularly in the government spending in the U.S. and China improving in the second half. So we were viewing ourselves as having a more favorable top line income environment for us into the second half. So I think we can expect to see improvements in the level of growth overall for the LDA business, the new Agilent business in the second quarter.
I think the other and you should look at is of course you say, okay, well it looks like a back end loaded forecast. But if you look at a historic performance, the fourth quarter is always very strong for us and there are a number of reasons why that happens. And we believe that the strength that we historically see in the fourth quarter will be there. And I guess the third thing I would add is that fueling our growth and fueling our market expansion is a line up of new products that have been coming out in the first half of this year and we will have some new launches coming up in the third quarter which we will highlight in a few weeks at the ASMS in bottom, which have been improved marketing structure as well.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
With respect to that new product comment you just made, can you give us any type of preview on what\xe2\x80\x99s on tap for ASMS coming up, when is the last time Agilent launched a new mass spectrometry system and any update on your latest efforts to further develop the ion mobility technology?
Mike McMullen
Sure. So, when we think about Agilent\xe2\x80\x99s mass spectrometry business, we think about really three categories of mass spectrometry, liquid phase LC-MS, GC-MS in the gas phase, and then ICP-MS was just focused on the elemental side. So, the most major new introduction for us was in the ICP-MS area where we introduced a brand new platform after Winter Plasma Conference in January. This comes on heels on introduction of an ICP triple quad about six months prior to that. And we are the only vendor that offers that high end capability in the marketplace. So over the last six months you have seen some brand new platform introductions in the ICP-MS area. And what you will see at ASMS and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take all the thunder away from the show and the excitement we are going to having here, but you will see new introductions coming from us in the GC-MS and the LC-MS area. And then we will talk more specifically Brandon at that conference about our continued investment in ion mobility and also our iFunnel technology preview of more details to come.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
Can you give us a view on your sense of the pricing environment between LC, GC, mass spec, is there any differentiation there. And where do you believe you have been most successful in capturing share between those core product buckets?
Mike McMullen
Yes. So, let me make sure I understand the question, so when you are asking about pricing relative to our pricing versus the competition?
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
Yes, pricing competition.
Mike McMullen
Sure. So, I feel overall macro the pricing pressure has stabilized as the macro market statement. When the markets were contracting there was a lot of aggressive pricing going on. I think we have seen stabilization in the marketplace and a number of our competitors have commented on their margin improvement plan. So I think but realized they are trying to win price alone is not a sustainable strategy. I think relative to the competition our value proposition plays across all of our platforms whether it would be GC-MS, ICP-MS, LC-MS. We are fortunate to have a very high level of customer trust with our customers that we have earned over the decades, very strong service experience tied with that to products that are innovative but the technology is really driven to improve what matters to the customer most, which is through application results. So, we are known for reliability performance. So, when we get into ability to hold our pricing we see that the kind of thesis, if you will, going across all of the product categories, albeit our share position is different in the three categories.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
In terms of the LC market where do you believe we are in the UHPLC adoption cycle, how much penetration have we seen the modality in QA/QC settings relative to research and what\xe2\x80\x99s your just general view of the LC market growth environment?
Mike McMullen
Yes. So, I think for the audience I think we are all familiar with the UHPLC transformation of this new technology provides real advantages of the customer in terms of speed and resolution of analysis. So, there is a real driver for customers to want to move this new technology. When we look at it from an Agilent perspective, Brandon, we think we are about halfway through the cycle. We think there is about 50% still to go, because you have to remember the very large installed base of LCs and there maybe the desire to move, but also there is the reality of the available capital.
What we have also seen is that particularly in pharma, where you have regulated methods, they really see the advantage of the new technology, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have to go through revalidation process. So, what Agilent has done is that we now offer an emulation mode, which allows our customers to run if you will the rolled applications on the new technology. So that\xe2\x80\x99s the way for us to help on the transformations.
In terms of the LC market, I think the market continues to be solid. I think there are some temporal types of events that happened for example, the food per shelf of spending in China as the food agencies have reorganized some of the cleanup in China in the pharma side. So, there has been some called temporal kind of disruptions in the market, but overall, the market seems to be quite solid. The segments that are really growing are the bio biopharma space, which as you know makes up about 20% of the marketplace. So, I think bio biopharma, UHPLC, and the continued growth in China are kind of fueling the LC market.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
If we look at your pharma business relative to the peers understanding, there is quite a bit of noise in the numbers, but it would appear that your pharma, your growth in the pharma space is ahead of the peer group, do you believe you are capturing share in that arena and what might that be a function of?
Mike McMullen
So, while we don\xe2\x80\x99t comment specifically on our market share position, we are pretty confident that we are picking up share against somebody. And the story is really a geographic story of our ability to grow in the U.S. by focusing on the mid-tier and specialty pharmaceutical companies and overall improving European marketplace and then really our strength that we developed over the years in China. And I think the story is and I was trying to hint out at this earlier is our view is it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about impacting the science of the lab, but it\xe2\x80\x99s about impacting the science and the economics of the lab. So, we have tried to build around our pharma story services capabilities, so that we can provide a full suite of asset management services to our customers, multi-vendor services irrespective of their decision on vendor equipment purchase, a vendor or an open architecture strategy around informatics, a consumable chemistry strategy built around optimizing customers\xe2\x80\x99 application irrespective of their choice on vendors.
So, I think what we have tried to do is build around our liquid chromatography portfolio, a full suite of services, informatics and chemistries. And we have also recognized both the economics and the science of this UHPLC discussion, right. So, we have got leading technology, which optimizes the customers\xe2\x80\x99 application results, but we also noticed the economics of it. So, if we can offer capabilities such as emulation, we can lower the cost of our customers to move to new technologies. I think those types of strategies are really customer driven, customer centric are the reason why you are seeing these growth rates above our peers.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
Have you seen any relative improvement in these large pharma demand environment coming out of a generally choppy first quarter? And where do you believe we are in terms of the replacement cycle within pharma broadly?
Mike McMullen
I think it\xe2\x80\x99s still if you will choppy in big pharma. The consolidation has been going on and is still going on has been impacting the business, but at the same point in time, they are very driven towards improving the productivity of the R&D activities and that\xe2\x80\x99s why in one hand there maybe more equipment that\xe2\x80\x99s on the market after consolidation. They are also moving facilities like (indiscernible) facility out of the U.S. and Europe, but they also are investing in new technologies. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I say it\xe2\x80\x99s choppy, because dependent on what segments you are in and where you are focused, it could actually be a favorable market environment for you. For example, as they move into MBEs, as they move more of the capability overseas if you have got the organizational capability and the portfolio, you can capture that growth. And I guess I would probably say the same story about the percentages you asked me about where we are in the installed base I think it\xe2\x80\x99s probably about halfway. We still think there is a lot still to go in the pharma space.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
Would that be true both in QA/QC as well as research or?
Mike McMullen
Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great question. I will say I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you absolute percentages, but I would say it\xe2\x80\x99s more to come in the QA/QC because that\xe2\x80\x99s where the predominant deployment of liquid chromatography is and it\xe2\x80\x99s also where you have the highest constraints if you will around the regulated application space and so also where typically companies are trying to be as operationally efficient as possible. So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s where a lot of it is going to come.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
I would like to shift over to the research products business the legacy Varian assets substantially, where do we stand in terms of getting that research products unit to a breakeven level, what have been the challenges that you have encountered with that business since you bought it?
Mike McMullen
Sure.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
I think back in 2010 and where are we in terms of those?
Mike McMullen
Yes, so maybe just kind of \xe2\x80\x93 we will just kind of zoom up and talk about the overall NMR market which is why that we want this technology and why do we think it\xe2\x80\x99s an important part of our growing portfolio, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of about $700 million to $800 million market with perhaps two real credible competitors in this space. And the \xe2\x80\x93 our customers across both the chemical analysis and life science market see NMR as a critical work tool for their research work and ongoing production activity.
Relative to what we had communicated to at our March Analyst Meeting we are tracking to that plan in terms of the rollout of our new ProPulse technologies. And I think we have provided an update at that time actually strategy around certain segments of that market, the OEM business which we didn\xe2\x80\x99t think made sense for us to begin long-term. I think the biggest challenge here is just the cycle time from the time you change your products so you go through the deal flow, so it actually shows up in revenue. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a much longer cycle time than we historically have had with other parts of the portfolio. So it\xe2\x80\x99s coming, but you will see it as the deal cycle longer these are often significant purchases of 400,000 to 500,000 they are long deal cycles. So, from the time you change your portfolio, so it rolls through the P&L is longer cycle. And then also keep in mind the reason why we had decided to exit some of these businesses was the margin structure around those business. We still need to flow that final piece of backlog through the P&L, but these are \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s a very good market to be in and it\xe2\x80\x99s very complementary technique to LC-MS.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
Is it that cycle dynamic or purely the burning off the excess backlog and getting the new products to contribute to the top line, is that the primary bridge to getting to a breakeven level?
Mike McMullen
Absolutely.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
Okay.
Mike McMullen
And as we have done and we have already put in place a number of the fundamentals in terms of the service experience and there are some things we can \xe2\x80\x93 we will continue to do on the supply chain side that will help on the margin structure as well. So, there is still some work still to be done on the manufacturing site consolidation piece. But I think the first two areas that you highlighted are their biggest drivers.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
Yes. So, how much \xe2\x80\x93 how many more periods, do you think we have to go in terms of legacy backlog burn, so to speak and will it be fair to say that the hurdles to this business being a breakeven type level in fiscal \xe2\x80\x9815 are fairly straightforward?
Mike McMullen
Yes. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t commented specifically on when that time will occur in terms of breakeven. But I think in terms of the where we need to flow off the backlog will be OEM MRI businesses probably 12 to 18 months kind of cycle from my understanding.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
Okay, superb. Switching over to just the core P&L within LDA where do you pursue the greatest opportunities for future profit margin leverage whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in gross margin, R&D, G&A and what if you view is the alternate EBIT opportunity for the LDA business?
Mike McMullen
Yes, I think we have been pretty transparent in terms of our view of our long-term operating model. We believe we can get to 20% to 22% operating margin under a 6% kind of revenue growth scenario, 30% to 40% incremental and why do we believe that. So if you look at our life sciences or LDG business, which we have referred to, we really front end loaded a lot of the investments. So, we build dedicated sales channel. So, the SG&A is running higher. We put a lot of money into the R&D portfolio investments. So, as we start to leverage those with the increased volume you will start to see the margin structure improving in that business. And as you heard from our Supply Chain President in March there are still additional things we can do in terms of site consolidation that will give us and value engineering will give us some margin flow through at the bottom line.
The other thing it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be lost is just the \xe2\x80\x93 our strategy in terms of transformation of the former Varian portfolio which is as we bring these new products to market they have a much improved margin structure. So for the chemical analysis business we believe we can continue to get a point improvement per year in terms of our gross margins, most of that will come from the former Varian product lines. And we are pretty close to being able to complete the portfolio refresh on spectroscopy within the next few quarters. So I think you will start to see this margin improvement steps that have been underway continue as we move forward.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
I guess to wrap up here as time went down, how large is your outside of Dako, how large is the revenue in terms of revenue is your business in clinical markets? Where do you perceive new opportunities to migrate the core technologies into the clinical arena?
Mike McMullen
I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we have disclosed a specific breakdown between the clinical and doctor business, but we are reporting as one entity. But what I can tell you is where do we see the growth with things such as cytogenetics the Micro Ray is going into the downstream clinic. We see the adoption of next-gen sequencing happening in the routine clinical market right now. Agilent is able to participate into that space through our chemistries and the workflow and our informatics. And then the adoption of mass spectrometry into these clinics as we continue to make the tools easier to use, more robust and that\xe2\x80\x99s plays to the strength of Agilent has with the breadth of portfolio across GC-MS, LC-MS large scale. So, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a combination of those technology areas as well as overall application trends, where we see creating opportunities for Agilent in the routine clinical market.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
Super. I think we will leave it there.
Mike McMullen
Okay. Thank you, Brandon.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies
Thanks so much.
Mike McMullen
Thank you for joining us today.
