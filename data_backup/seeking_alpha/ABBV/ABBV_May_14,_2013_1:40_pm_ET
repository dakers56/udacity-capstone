Greg Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Welcome everybody, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get started. Special thanks to our BofA Merrill Lynch clients for attending and welcome to those of you on the webcast. I\xe2\x80\x99m Greg Gilbert. I cover specialty and major pharma here for the firm in the U.S., and we are very pleased to have for the first time at this event, AbbVie, as the next presenting company. Bill Chase, the CFO is here as well as Scott Brun, who is VP of Pharmaceutical Development. Obviously, great to have someone from the R&D team here at this time in the company\xe2\x80\x99s evolution.
What we thought we would do is just kick it over to Bill to make some high level remarks and we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it in sort of the true fireside chat without the fire of course, because it\xe2\x80\x99s warm enough here. But I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d ask Bill to just kick it off from a high level and talk about AbbVie as the pre-spin company and now the post-spin company and some of the interesting findings and learnings, and where we go from here, and I would encourage you all to get your hand up to the microphone and we can cover a vast variety of topics, here we have 29 minutes to do it. So over to you guys, and thank you very much for attending.
William J. Chase
\n', b'
So Greg, thank you. Okay. Thank you very much for inviting us. We\xe2\x80\x99re actually thrilled to be here. We\xe2\x80\x99re about four months into the spin and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell it\xe2\x80\x99s been a very, very exciting four months for all of us. I\xe2\x80\x99d say that the company and our experience has been going just absolutely steadily. We spun on January 2. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got an employee base that\xe2\x80\x99s very, very energized and excited. We got through the first quarter. We actually delivered earnings $0.02 above our EPS guidance range and we had very, very strong underlying sales, which really was a testament to the true strength of this business.
We grew our top line about 5% on operational terms and that was despite a loss of exclusivity of employing through our generics, our lipids franchise, so very, very strong business execution in the first quarter, HUMIRA continues to perform and really deliver to our expectations. The product grew 17% in the first quarter, 24% growth in the U.S., 13% Ex-U.S., so it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly living up to everything we thought that HUMIRA would be, and then our pipeline is progressing nicely as well.
We\xe2\x80\x99ve got \xe2\x80\x93 our trial were up and running in HCV, our other late-stage assets are moving along very, very nicely. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got seven assets in Phase II, which will be entering Phase III over the next 12 months to 18 months. And this morning we announced a deal with a company called [Irvine] it\xe2\x80\x99s a brand yeah another compound into our stable, so the pipeline is developing very nicely as well. So, so far, so good after four months, we\xe2\x80\x99re thrilled to be here.
Greg Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Maybe Scott, I could ask you to comment a little bit on your background and what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the high level in the R&D organization than more drilled down into some more specific?
Scott Brun
Yeah, absolutely Greg again, thanks forever. So as you can see I\xe2\x80\x99m not John Leonard, but I worked with John Leonard for my 16 years at AbbVie \xe2\x80\x93 Abbott AbbVie physician by training and it was actually involved in the development of our protease inhibitor Kaletra back in the late 90s. I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked in a variety of therapeutic areas at Abbott ranging from the renal, the OEM analogy franchise, and most recently over the past several years, have been responsible for our virology development group, specifically our HCV strategy.
So certainly with John\xe2\x80\x99s decision to retire, we will miss him as our leader, as our teacher, as our mentor, but I think we\xe2\x80\x99re extremely well poised to execute on the strategy that in the legacy that John help to build.
Greg Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a last question [Tory], I want to just kick it back to Bill momentarily. Dividends and our returning cash to shareholders has been near and dear to my heart as part of our thesis in major pharma and when I get to know you guys early on, I was very clear that you took that, did I say, duty very seriously, can you reiterate for the audience sort of what the long-term game plan is as it relates to cash flow deployment?
William J. Chase
Sure. One of the things that\xe2\x80\x99s very attractive AbbVie is we generate a lot of cash off of our products. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a very, very stable business that generates very healthy cash returns. And so we take that cash very seriously and we think hard about what we want to do with it. Our first priority will always be to reinvest in the business and that could be in the form of plant equipment, but more probably really building out the pipeline, that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen us over the last few years, selectively adding late-stage assets into our pipeline. So that\xe2\x80\x99s high priority for us.
Second is returning cash to shareholders. And we fundamentally believe that a strong dividend is the best thing to do for investors when it comes to returning cash; and not just a strong dividend, but actually a growing dividend. So when we actually split the company, we set a payout ratio that was in the upper half of the peer group, actually a little higher than that, and we even made extra commitment to grow that dividend even despite a relatively flat top line as our lipids franchise played through loss of exclusivity events.
So that dividend growth will be modest in the short-term, because of the flat top line, but you can expect to see our payout ratio as a result actually increased over that period. And then as the pipeline kicks in most notably HCV, we\xe2\x80\x99d expect to see that dividend increase more rapidly, although frankly the business will also be increasing very rapidly on the bottom line, and so that payout ratio may decline to a certain extent. But we still are going to benchmark it relative to our peers and make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s in the upper half of the peer group.
We\xe2\x80\x99d like to pay down a little bit of debt over the period of \xe2\x80\x93 the next few years. We think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got cash to do that. And then we have in February, we authorized for a share buyback program for achieving about $1.5 billion. The role of that program will be primarily to offset dilution from option activity. We still think the primary means to deliver cash to shareholders will be that growing dividend.
Greg Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And from an M&A standpoint, you guys have been smart acquirers in the past, is the size and type of deal you\xe2\x80\x99ve done in the past indicative of how you think about your M&A strategy going forward?
William J. Chase
Yeah, Greg, if you look at what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done over the last three to four years, we have selectively augmented our pipeline with Phase IIA assets, Phase IIB assets, which have basically shown proof-of-concepts in the therapeutic areas that we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on. Now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had pretty great success doing that. We brought in nine compounds over the last three years and as the deal that we announced today shows we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to look at those sorts of deal. We will look at smallish tuck-ins, as well as I think fast that was a great example of a smallish acquisition that brought us in multiple assets for about $450 million net cash.
So, physically prudent L&A activities, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be an important part going forward, because fundamentally, we don\xe2\x80\x99t think any one organization has monopoly on innovation. We do think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to test the buyer sec world for very interesting science and compounds and we\xe2\x80\x99ve shown we have success in doing that. Bigger than that, we don\xe2\x80\x99t really have a compelling need to go out and do a big acquisition.
We certainly have the financial wherewithal to do it. But frankly if you look at the assets that we have in terms of broad geographic reach, an organization that can execute very well in our therapeutic areas that we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on management capabilities, there is not much reason why we need to run out and buy anything big, Greg, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the scale we need. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the things that\xe2\x80\x99s really attractive about AbbVie. So we \xe2\x80\x93 that allows us to really focus on more incremental pipeline builders as a strategy.
Greg Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Let me ask one more before I kick it over to the audience. I know comment a question upfront, if anyone else doesn\xe2\x80\x99t first, but back to you Scott, how would you describe the company\xe2\x80\x99s seat at the table on hepatitis C, it seems like things change weekly and you\xe2\x80\x99re probably aware of the fact that the street things someone else will 90% and you will get 10 or less. So maybe you can frame your answers along those lines, but just a lot has changed since AbbVie became a standalone company, maybe get us up to-date and how you describe that?
Scott Brun
Absolutely, well, first of all we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the 10 or less and we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to stand for 10 or less. We think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a very strong seat at the table. Just to update you on our program, we are well into Phase III with fixed trials, they are looking at a comprehensive program in genotype one with our 3-DAA regimen within without ribavirin. These studies have been conducted in 30 countries around the world and they are enrolling extremely well. There is tremendous\xe2\x80\xa6
Unidentified Company Representative
Too extremely, that was too extremely. Let me just say I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing this for a long time and it\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable how quickly we are getting patients into these trials. I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s like opening up, but there is a tremendous amount of demand for this regimen. So we\xe2\x80\x99re very pleased with where we are at right now. And look, we\xe2\x80\x99re sticking with the same strategy that we established when we embarked on Interferon pre-combination several years ago. Our goal is to provide patients the best possible chain expert here, it\xe2\x80\x99s about SBR, let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget.
This is a deadly disease, it can result in extremely dire consequences for patients if you are not successful in eradicating the virus. So what we are doing is looking to maximize those SBR rates across genotype 1 populations be their prior non-responders to Interferon if they\xe2\x80\x99ve got sclerosis. And with 2,000 patients and very specific studies that are looking at these different populations, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to provide patients and clinicians the confidence in the Interferon pre-regimen that they will be selecting.
I think the Aviator study or Phase 2b over 500 patients and still the most comprehensive genotype 1 Interferon pretrial presented to-date. The performance of the regimens across the board just gives us very, very strong confidence in this 3-DAA 12-week backbone, that is really the foundation of the Phase III trial and our program at it.
Greg Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Before Tom ask the question, we care to predict timeline of you versus them in quotes?
William J. Chase
I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give everyone the level of granularity, but they are probably looking for. We are still seeing a mid-2014 filing with a 2015 commercialization, but we are moving fast and you can rest assure this is a prime focus for AbbVie in the development organization. My colleague Tom Bristow has a question.
Greg Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I know you have a lead on ABT-199. Perhaps you could just offer us some color or just explain what happened with regards to the suspension in the clinical trials that cumulates syndrome and where we are now with regards to the next step forward?
William J. Chase
Yeah, absolutely. So ABT-199, our BCL-2 inhibitor, which by its method of action actually interferes with cellular signaling that allows cancer cells to remain immortal. So it essentially promotes self destruction of these cells with certain hematologic malignancies being more susceptible to its effects than others. Late last year in our exploratory studies as a consequence of this exquisite potency particularly in CLL, we saw some cases of so called tumor lysis syndrome, which again are direct consequence of killing cells when they spill out their electrolyte. It can lead to consequences in patients if it happens too quickly.
Subsequently, in consultation with Genentech as well as the FDA, we made the decision to hold these trials to look at the data that we\xe2\x80\x99ve accumulated in order to identify patients who might be at highest risk for TLS, and really to devise the dosing scheme, where we start a bit lower than we had in the original protocol and so to increase the dose on a more gentle glide path, also making sure that we had in place more active prophylaxis and then on top of it, really, really, monitor the patients, so we can collect the data to really determine what is the optimal management of these patients.
So in malignancies other than CLL, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloma, where there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a regulatory hold, but we had paused dosing. In April, we started dosing in those trials and what I am very pleased to tell you all today is that on the CLL with discussions with the FDA, they are comfortable with our approach, the hold has been lifted and we are in the process of reinitiating the dosing scheme with 199 and are very enthusiastic about the potential for this compound in hematologic malignancies. Any questions out there?
William J. Chase
(Inaudible), fourth row back.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi. I will take a follow-on on that 199, so just to, [could you state] you can as to your plans for Phase III, which I think is the next step, and is it more appropriate to think about it as a monotherapy or combo? And, if it\xe2\x80\x99s combo given the breadth of Roche\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio, which of Rituxan and GA101, the ADC is most appropriate to combo this with? Thank you.
William J. Chase
Very good question, first of all, our plans are to enter Phase III this year in relapsed/refractory patients as well as those with the 17 P genetic background. We will be approaching this both with monotherapy as well as combinations. We have ongoing combination studies with Roche right now in the compounds Rituxan as well as GA101 and we\xe2\x80\x99re working through our plans right now with regard to finalizing what that study will \xe2\x80\x93 there those studies rather will look like, but yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99re on track for this year.
Greg Gilbert
\n', b'
We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a follow-up, I\xe2\x80\x99ll repeat it.
Unidentified Analyst
\n', b'
(Inaudible)?
Greg Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Will you disclose the Phase III protocol at ASCO is the question?
William J. Chase
We\xe2\x80\x99re going to disclose some additional data on 199. We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be providing the exact granularity on the Phase III program at ASCO. In the very back we have a couple of questions and that one is about Hep C, just guessing. Hi, [Rachel].
Unidentified Analyst
Hi. Just wanted to ask about how important the big picture, how important is that for you to innovate in hepatitis C, I guess, some, for example, to get rid of ritonavir to \xe2\x80\x93 a separate question would be to include a higher barrier to resistance drug in the regimen, to reduce pill burden, care further, shorten treatment duration and just as a sort of a picture, again, we have seen to be very focused on kind of constantly innovating on the regimen or should we expect this to be the final statement or albeit or look forward to more innovations from you? Thank you.
Unidentified Company Representative
Great question, look forward to more innovation. This is far from the final step from AbbVie. Certainly, while we feel we have a very compelling regimen, we acknowledge that there are places where things can be improved. We actually have a protease and an NS5A inhibitor that\xe2\x80\x99s already in early stage clinical development. Very favorable pharmacokinetic profile as well as some, let me just say, a very intriguing resistance characteristic in reference to one of the points that you made. This combination will not require ritonavir, at least in the replicon, it appears to be pan-genotypic and we are aggressively moving back forward at the same time that we are progressing with our core regimen.
I should also note that even with the core regimen, there are opportunities for potential improvement in certain population. For example, in Japan, the world\xe2\x80\x99s second largest market, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the co-formulation of our PI and our NS5A, which results in two pills; once a day, no ribavirin 12 weeks, which in genotype 1b in Japan Phase II study is performing very, very well. And so there is again, a consequence for, at this particular regimen, to be suitable in parts of the world where genotype 1b is quite prevalent
Greg Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And just a follow-up then, so you mentioned the NS5A and protease inhibitor in early stage development, when would you be in a position to publically present some data to give us some insight into how that would look?
William J. Chase
Well, I think as you know from the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve handled Pilot and Co-Pilot, we tend to like to do our homework and see what we got, and so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make any promises. But things are progressing nicely and maybe late this year or early next year, you may be hearing more, although, again, with a number of Phase III studies that we have ongoing, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a lot to say and it\xe2\x80\x99s just going to be a matter of managing the communication for our gain. We like to know what we have before we jump out and make too many prior combinations.
Greg Gilbert
\n', b'
Thanks, [Rachel]. There\xe2\x80\x99s a question up here in the third row. While the mic is coming up, I want to shift gears real quick though and ask you about tax rate another sort of pet issue for us in the pharmaceutical industry. Can you just tell us what your long-term plans are from a tax planning standpoint?
William J. Chase
Sure. We look at the tax rate really hard when we split the companies and it became very clear when we looked at the uses that we had for our cash and the importance of the dividend, became very clear that we had to take the tax rate up and we modeled that very carefully and the rate that we ultimately came out with, 22%, was the rate that allowed us to meet all of our long-term objectives. I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good assumption that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to stay about 22%. That said, we still do very, very serious tax planning to build the most efficient structure possible on all of our new programs as we bring them up to see. So in the event if there was any type of tax reform in the U.S., we can certainly take advantage of that, but given the status quo that we have right now, that 22% rate pretty much does everything we need it to do when we balance the various priorities we have around cash.
Greg Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Sure, got it.
Unidentified Analyst
Two questions; one is on capital deployment priorities. Do you \xe2\x80\x93 you reiterated your commitment to return capital to shareholders via dividends. You\xe2\x80\x99ve announced about $600 million for dividends per quarter that\xe2\x80\x99s about $2.5 billion per year, and then you have $1.5 billion in share repurchases. Can you quantify the percentage of free cash flow you\xe2\x80\x99ve committed returning to shareholders?
Unidentified Company Representative
Yeah we haven\xe2\x80\x99t made the commitment of \xe2\x80\x93 that we are going to return X percent of free cash flow. We have focused on payout ratio. We made sure that we got that payout ratio from a dividend standpoint very, very competitively as I said before. We do have the share buyback authorization, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean we\xe2\x80\x99re always going to be out buying shares. The primary means to return cash to shareholders is the dividend and what I would tell you is the best way to measure our objective there is to really look at where we set that payout ratio and kind of follow the math that I shared with you earlier in terms of how that payout could move as our bottom line changes over the next few years.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you, are you, do you plans to increase like is it trend up in terms of dividends over the next\xe2\x80\xa6
Unidentified Company Representative
Yeah, so in the near-term given that we have relatively flat top line as our lipids franchise goes through a loss of exclusivity event, that increase of dividend will more modest. However, we are committed to increasing the dividend, and then as the late stage pipeline kicks in most notably HCV we see that dividend increasing at a faster pace. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s the dynamic I would expect to see.
Unidentified Analyst
On the larger acquisition, does the tax free nature of your (inaudible) limit you in terms of how large of an acquisition you can do, if it does, if there is a timeframe when that limit goes off?
William J. Chase
No, not particularly, I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got access from the capital markets. We could \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99ve got plenty of cash as well. We have the financial whereabouts to do a larger deal if we wanted to. That said, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that we need to do a larger deal. As I said before if you really look at the attributes of this business, we have the key assets that we need, we would like more pipeline, we\xe2\x80\x99ll always want more pipeline and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be very focused on building that pipeline out through incremental deals, but large deals are not really compelling to us right now.
Unidentified Analyst
Thanks, and just one last one from me, in terms of your rating targets do you have any now you hold strongly or are you committed to current ratings until you decide an upgrade?
William J. Chase
Our credit rating is very important to us. We think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a strong credit rating right now and that certainly, if you look at the debt transaction we did last fall, it appears that the market thinks our debt rating is or our debt \xe2\x80\x93 our credit quality is very, very high as well. But certainly, the rating agencies and our credit ratings are very, very important to us.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay.
Greg Gilbert
\n', b'
The dividend raising process is that something you and the team recommends to the board and that gets agreed upon or not at the end of a calendar year, can you just describe that process?
William J. Chase
Certainly, any dividend increase has to be approved by the board. What I would tell you is the strategy and the importance of our dividend as part of our overall investor identity has had a heavy board involvement. So there is obviously a line around that point.
Greg Gilbert
\n', b'
Sure. I want to ask you both the question on very important topic called HUMIRA, when does HUMIRA growth in your view become HUMIRA shrinkage and (inaudible) in sort of not like after HUMIRA, but some of the franchise building you are doing in R&D both to protect HUMIRA, and prove it in your other approaches in RA and some of the other diseases?
William J. Chase
So if you look at HUMIRA, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had incredible growth in this brand. Over the last five to six years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve grown this brand in over $1 billion per year. I think given our guidance on HUMIRA in 2013, you can certainly expect to see similar type growth and so incredible growth potential and really that growth comes from four main areas.
First of all, if you look at the actual market themselves, so those patients that would be eligible to use a biologic, the biologic penetration rates are still remarkably low. In RA, for example, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got penetration rates in the U.S. in the low 20s, low to mid 20s. We get out to derm, for example, you are at 5% to 6%. So we see incredible opportunity to continue to grow the penetration in the gastroderm and rheumatology segment. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s driving the double-digit market growth overseas and the high single-digit market growth in the U.S. Now, we\xe2\x80\x99re growing faster than the market, which means we\xe2\x80\x99re actually picking up share.
That\xe2\x80\x99s our second avenue of growth and then certainly we are committed to studying a variety of new indication. We expect to have new indications deliver between another $1 billion to $1.5 billion of growth over the next four to five years. And then finally, if you look in the non-developed market or the emerging markets, if you will, those penetration rates are still yet lower, so there is an entire geographic expansion angle. So a lot of talk about growth and the reason why I highlight that is we believe that when you look at those drivers, you can expect to see this brand grow certainly out to the 2018, 2019, halfway 2020, before it begins to level off.
Greg Gilbert
Thank you for that and the R&D effort?
William J. Chase
No, R&D, Greg, we\xe2\x80\x99re already thinking about what comes beyond HUMIRA in the immunologic space, I mean specifically, the question being can we out HUMIRA, can we find the way to come up with drugs that will be even more active than HUMIRA in core indications. And we are taking a multi-model approach both with small molecule biologics, as well as internally and externally sourced innovation. So certainly, we have jack programs both in partnership with Galapagos, as well as their own internal, the idea there that selectivity is your friend. If you can be more selective, you can potentially dose higher and obtain more efficacy and avoid some of the side effects that you see with the non-selective jacks.
Certainly, I think the proof-of-concept study with Galapagos is extremely encouraging to the point that we\xe2\x80\x99ve moved into a very large 800 patient Phase IIB definitive dose ranging. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got biotech collaboration with anti-CD4, an alternative mechanism to approach this. And there is certainly proprietary dual variable domain in (inaudible) and essentially a bispecific type approach. We can get two targets with a large protein and looking at enhanced TNF approach is that, if you hit another biologic mediator in addition to TNF, can you get even better efficacy. And so it\xe2\x80\x99s a multiple short-term goal type of approach in which we are currently very active.
Greg Gilbert \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Is there anything specific you would like to point to in terms of ULAR and the important to event this year as it relates to your program?
William J. Chase
You don\xe2\x80\x99t try to think, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly with regard to the ULAR data releases. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that there will be anything transformational beyond what we probably already discussed, again we are at a transition state on many of these programs moving into Phase IIB on the HUMIRA and the new indications; hidradenitis, uveitis Phase III programs that are progressing very nicely that where we want them. They are right on track, but nothing truly disruptive probably at this (inaudible). Are there questions out there?
Greg Gilbert
Bill, I am going to ask you question about guidance and a philosophy around sort of how much you like dropped through versus reinvesting to the extent HUMIRA continues to over-deliver this year and may be even in each year for which you guide, what\xe2\x80\x99s the wish list for reinvestment and what\xe2\x80\x99s your philosophy around how much should be reinvested versus not?
William J. Chase
Well, I certainly think reinvestment in pipeline is critical, right, and that could take two forms; it can take doing deals and it can also take the form of just investing more out of your P&L. One of the things we\xe2\x80\x99ve done fairly judiciously over the last few years, last six months is actually increase the funding into R&D and so where as uveitis business historically, we probably had about 13.5% of sales. This year, we\xe2\x80\x99re saying could be between 14% to 15% and frankly as we look at the maturation of our pipeline and more compounds being moved into Phase III, we could certainly see that actually pick all the way up to 16%.
So pipeline is absolutely critical. From an SG&A standpoint, there is an opportunity I think as HUMIRA grows for you to see some profile improvement. That said, HUMIRA is incredibly, incredibly important brand, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do everything we can to make sure it is fully funded and then additionally as you start to look at \xe2\x80\x9814 and \xe2\x80\x9815 and \xe2\x80\x9816, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of new products coming out of the pipeline. We are going to make sure that we fund those things appropriately that make sure that we deliver upon all of the promise. So you will see some SG&A moving into the new products as well. We think when we look at the pipeline, there is still going to be room for a lot to fall through to the bottom line as well.

That\xe2\x80\x99s right.

And we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of assets in Phase III. As they hit the market, you will see margin expansion.

Just ignore the [beast] with the one last question here from Tom, so just make it a good one.
Unidentified Analyst
ABT-126, you said you\xe2\x80\x99ll move that into Phase III in 2014 in the first step with many other late-stage compounds that have fallen before you. What have you seen so far that gives you confident in that investment? And what have you perhaps learnt from the trial of rhinovirus sale drug?
Unidentified Company Representative
Yeah, so 126, our Alpha7 NNR compound, certainly we are currently in Phase IIB in Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s both as add-on to Fipamezole and its monotherapy as well as in cognitive deficits associated with cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be presenting some of our initial proof of concept data monotherapy and Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s at the AAIC Meeting in July where you can see what prompted us to continue on into our Phase IIB where we are actually looking at a very wide dose range. Given the safety profile, we are even going beyond what we did in the proof of concept.
I think we have learned a lot that good trial hygiene matters tremendously in these indications. I mean, just the ability to be able to consistently demonstrate that Fipamezole is better than placebo is not necessarily always established by many competitors and so we put a number of things in place to really make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got so-called a strong assay sensitivity. And in our trials, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very consistently been able to show the effective donepezil versus placebo. So we feel that gives us a very, very strong platform to be able to pullout the signals from new mechanisms like ABT-126.
