Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Okay. Good morning, everyone. Good afternoon for those who are listening on the webcast. I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to host what will be my last session of the last three days, but I\xe2\x80\x99m really pleased to host AbbVie and very excited to have you both here, Bill Chase, the CFO of the Company and Scott Brun, who is Head of Development of AbbVie, overseeing the management of multiple global projects and \xe2\x80\x93 so again thank you very much both of you for being here at what has been a very exciting, what how many months not too many, three?
William J. Chase
About we are in six.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Six months as an independent Company?
William J. Chase
Yeah.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Before we begin, I\xe2\x80\x99m obligated to read disclosures. We are required to make certain disclosures in public appearances about Goldman Sachs\xe2\x80\x99s relationships with companies that we discuss. The disclosures relate to investment banking relationships, compensation received or 1% or more ownership. I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to read disclosures for any issuer now or at the end of this call, if anyone would like me to. However, these disclosures are available in our most recent reports available to U.S. clients on our firm\xe2\x80\x99s portal.
So with that, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start with you Bill and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to kind of draw questions out at both of you and hopefully there will be audience participation. So AbbVie as an independent company now for about six months and so far business seems to be pretty good. Your share price performance has done quite well. Tell us what is that like to be an independent company from AbbVie? How has your day to day changed? How is the new structure the company impacted the way that you operate?
William J. Chase
Sure. Well, first of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure to be here. As you said, we\xe2\x80\x99re in our six months of independent and I would tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s gone very, very smoothly. We separated in January 2nd without any bumps whatsoever. This was a Company that was operating somewhat autonomously within Abbott pre-spin, so we hit the ground running and the business is doing great on the execution front. In terms of what\xe2\x80\x99s different \xe2\x80\x93 what\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful about this business is its relatively simple business model, right. At the end of the day, it\xe2\x80\x99s about making sure we achieve everything we can with Humira, which has tremendous growth potential and it\xe2\x80\x99s about making sure our pipeline ultimately is launched and drives meaningful growth.
So that\xe2\x80\x99s basically what we\xe2\x80\x99re aligned around. It\xe2\x80\x99s about those two things in building out the pipeline and since we have spun, certainly what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is the ability to fund our P&L, fund our investments a little bit differently than we did when we were part of Abbott. Not that was bad at Abbott, but frankly when you\xe2\x80\x99re a pure-play pharma, you have less competing priorities and particularly when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the business model that we have that priorities are pretty clear.
So, we again certainly more liberal in funding R&D and I think Scott\xe2\x80\x99s pipeline is funded better than it ever had again. And likewise on the SG&A front, we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can to not only protect Humira, but to make sure that brand is as big as it can possibly be.
And I think from a decision making standpoint, that\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing changes as well. I mean, again the simple business model, the lack of competing priorities, the fact that our cash flow can be dedicated purely to this business, it drives much more rapid decision making.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Scott, have you seen \xe2\x80\x93 I mean what are the changes that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen since you\xe2\x80\x99ve been part of this independence. Like give us some specific examples of how you\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to move more rapidly in making decisions.
Scott Brun
I think a lot of this again comes to the nimbleness in terms of having the proximity to Bill to Rick with regard to funding decision. So before if we were following the data had some interesting observations from a particular program, wanted to expand upon that or based on the external environment we saw some new opportunities. There were much greater constraints and trade-offs that had to be made in order to pursue those ideas. Here, I mean, Bill is so actively involved as Rick in the pipeline that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to get that funding with a minimum of deriving, it\xe2\x80\x99s really just \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s a discussion making our case and moving forward and that has been a tremendous change.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Yeah. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that we as shareholders or investors necessarily see and I think that is an advantage to be in a pure-play Company and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that with other healthcare spin-offs that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the share price that reflected in terms of the PE arbitrage, but there is an efficiency in the way a business operate.
William J. Chase
And an incredible alignment as well
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Right, right.
Scott Brun
Like I mean you see it in things even though our HCV program has been ongoing since before the spin, it was certainly managed in that same sort of spirit and culture. Here our ability to rapidly expand external collaborations as we announced with Galapagos increasing the size of a Phase III study starting something in Crohn\'s. Again, having that the partnership with Bill and Rick to be able to do that nimbly is a big difference.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
So AbbVie was initially pitched to investors as a value \xe2\x80\x93 as the value play. Abbott was the growth play and AbbVie was the value play with a hefty dividend. Even though you\xe2\x80\x99re now looking more like the growth play. While you\xe2\x80\x99re facing competition in the cardio franchise and Humira seem to be performing better than expected, how should investors think about AbbVie\xe2\x80\x99s growth prospects, considering all the pushes and the pulls in the near-term and in the longer term?
William J. Chase
I think that there is a bit of confusion that we\xe2\x80\x99ve always viewed AbbVie long-term as a growth play. When you look at Humira the growth potential of Humira and there are solid growth drivers behind Humira along with our pipeline. We always knew in 2015 we were going to return to growth and we thought that growth would be sustainable. In the short-term to your point though, we were moving to a time of transition where our lipid franchise was coming off patents and frankly we did use the dividend somewhat to support us from a yield standpoint, but \xe2\x80\x9915 isn\xe2\x80\x99t that far away, its six month closer than it was on January 2nd and we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that as the pipeline kicks in and layers in on top of Humira and the lipid get behind us, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be a very attractive growth investment.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Are there opportunities that you see in the P&L as a standalone Company, opportunities in terms of further streamlining? For example, and I noticed you recently made cuts to your cardiovascular sales force, but is there a further streamlining that we could see also on the procurement side again as a standalone Company? I mean, initially I think there is probably dissynergies that if we look at the P&L longer term, where do you think you could squeeze more out?
William J. Chase
Yeah. So, I start first by saying we got a pretty efficient P&L, okay. I certainly think we can squeeze more out on the gross margin line without a doubt. R&D, we\xe2\x80\x99re frankly going to invest to our opportunities and frankly we think R&D as a percentage of sales will increase, it has increased and we think that\xe2\x80\x99s prudent for the long-term. SG&A is interesting. I think if you look at the dynamics of Humira and you look at the size that Humira can ultimately grow to, you would expect to see some margin expansion there.
However, also at the same time you got to weigh that against a very, very important launch in \xe2\x80\x9915 on HCV as well as the remaining pipeline. So, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure we do everything we can to fund those launches successfully and as a result you may see SG&A tick up a little bit and then over time see it come down. I think that the real opportunities for streamlining efficiencies in the P&L really are going to be on the gross margin line. And certainly some of our business models we will adapt a more efficient business model then we had when we were at Abbott, for example back office and G&A expenses, IT infrastructure. We will move to an outsource model that is ultimately little bit more cutting edge than what we were dealing within a legacy basis and should bring some cost efficiencies.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
In terms of a basis point, in terms of how many margin points of improvement can we expect from just the change to your procurement as oppose to just mix?
William J. Chase
Yeah, I mean we \xe2\x80\x93 we haven\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily given long-term guidance on that. But I do think you will see some meaningful improvement on the gross margin line over the next five years. Although to be fair 2014 maybe a step back as we play through the rest of this lipid issue.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
And how much of that is \xe2\x80\x93 that relates to Scott\xe2\x80\x99s pipeline? How much of that is just the margin impact the \xe2\x80\x93 higher margin impact from some of the biological and specialty drugs that you\'re developing?
William J. Chase
Well, in the short-term lipids was very, very high margin, right. So as lipids go away, HCV will be a beautiful product from a margin standpoint. Humira has a very, very nice margin profile certainly in the long-term as the royalty burden start disappear, that margin will improve as well. But that\'s not the only margin play that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got going on. We are certainly taking actions to make sure that we streamline our supply chain, our plant structure etcetera and we\'re always looking at those sorts of things.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Focusing on Humira guidance this year, I think its low double-digit growth, which was part of your guidance. If price increases and prescription trends seem to suggest a trend that\xe2\x80\x99s faster than lower double-digits, what do you think is going on in the market? We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a new entrance with Xeljanz and I think many investors are surprised by the durability and the strength of its franchise. What has been a surprise to you? And the low double-digits, the year isn\xe2\x80\x99t over, we got a long way to go still, but I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious to know your thoughts on what you\'re seeing so far?
William J. Chase
I would say that Xeljanz was playing out very much the way we had modeled it. Frankly having said that, still early days their GTC has just begun, but frankly when we look at this market, it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had multiple new MOAs under the market over the last three to four years and yet the core \xe2\x80\x93 the three core anti-TNFs have maintained 85% of share. And the reason for that is at the end of the day these are therapies that are very well understood. The efficacy is very, very strong, the safety is very well understood as well, these are 10-year old therapies and there is no compelling reason whatsoever to switch a well-tolerated patient into a new therapy.
So these new entrants they have to either compete for naive patients and frankly difficult to compete there given that the safety record is somewhat unknown or they move in the backend line for failures, and that\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately where we saw Xeljanz is playing out. Those are attractive spaces. We have got some very large brands back there, but frankly they had difficult time penetrating the sweet spot of the anti-TNFs.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
So is your Galapagos assets then just an insurance policy or how do you see that playing out?
William J. Chase
So, we are in \xe2\x80\x93 and ultimately I let Scott talk about the actual asset, but the strategy there is we do feel that it differentiated oral JAK with higher efficacy could have a impact if we stay in the market and that\xe2\x80\x99s the strategy.
Scott Brun
Yeah,
We also have an internal JAK that\'s in Phase 1, so bit behind where Galapagos is, ABT-494. We have another external collaboration with Biotest on an anti-CD4 antibody. So, a totally different mechanism to see can you increase that efficacy bar over the TNFs. And then we actually have our own proprietary bi-specific biologic technology called Dual Variable Domain Immunoglobulins or DVD. Think about it as a giant antibody that\xe2\x80\x99s able to hit two targets and we have ABT-122 that is targeting both TNF as well as IL-17 in another inflammatory mediator and that\xe2\x80\x99s currently in early clinical development in the Phase 1-2 stage.
So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got sort of a diversified strategy with both internal and external opportunity small molecules and biologics again to build on these foundational indications that the Humira.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
And just thinking about the timeline, Humira goes generic in 2017 and 2018, would you expect some of these newer opportunities to be on the market by then, and is that sort of a strategy to offset biosimilar competition?
Scott Brun
Yeah, I think its part of \xe2\x80\x93 it is one part of our overall diversified portfolio to do so. The Galapagos Phase IIb in rheumatoid arthritis should be reading out in late 2014, and again based on the design of that study that should position us well to be able to enter Phase III with that company.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Scott, I think there was data this morning at EULAR, which may have created a little bit of a stir, uncertainty or I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there, but can you clarify for investors what was shown at EULAR and I think related to the Galapagos JAK?
Scott Brun
Sure. So these were data related to the initial proof of concept study in rheumatoid arthritis. That was a placebo controlled study. It looked at I think it was four different \xe2\x80\x93 four to five, I think it was several different dose levels of the Galapagos JAK inhibitor. And there were couple of things that I believe some analysts keyed off on, for example the fact that in the placebo arm the ACR 20 response was higher than one typically sees in these types of studies, and then does that draw under question the efficacy conclusion.
There\xe2\x80\x99s also a comment about some changes, some drops in neutrophil count. And to address both of those, first I\xe2\x80\x99ll say remember that each dose level had only about 15 to 20 patients per arm. And when you look at the overall study in aggregate, you look across all the doses, you look at the ACR 20s, 50s, 70s, the DAF, the CRP you\xe2\x80\x99ll actually see a very nice dose response that demonstrates to us and Galapagos, that indeed this compound is active in the range that we want to see it. And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the purpose of the Phase IIb study is going from 15 to 20 to 70 to 80 patients to arm to really gain high level of confidence on exactly what that efficacy looks like.
With regard to the neutrophils, the changes that we saw through four weeks and again that\xe2\x80\x99s another caveat of over interpreting the absolute numbers that this is only four weeks that we got some of the scores that we saw even with the short-term and we know that the ACRs and the DAFs continue to improve the treatment over time. But back to the neutrophils, the changes seen are really in the same ballpark that has been observed with Tofacitinib, Xeljanz. So that maybe mechanistically related. But again the question comes and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the answer is, are you going to see the same level of neutrophil changes that dose that we eventually go forward with based on the overall profile taking the efficacy into account.
The other interesting thing is we saw no changes in the lymphocytes which again chronically you can sometimes see with JAK inhibitor. So again, when you take the study in totality and look at the data comprehensively, we\xe2\x80\x99re very pleased with what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Bill a question for you. Do you think your portfolio of pipeline assets are diversified enough?
William J. Chase
Yeah, I mean I think we\xe2\x80\x99re very, very pleased with the diversification within our pipeline, and actually we\xe2\x80\x99re very pleased with the extent that our pipeline has matured over the last two to three years and that\xe2\x80\x99s been a big part internally and externally. That said, I think we recognize you can never have enough pipeline and we\xe2\x80\x99re constantly on a lookout of finding ways to bring additional compounds and you saw our deal earlier this year with Alvine for celiac disease. And I think you will see us continue to do the sorts of deals that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done over the last three years, largely compound specific maybe occasionally a small tuck in acquisition for pipeline reasons. And we found it\'s a prudent way to build up pipeline. We are an attractive partner and we certainly have the financial capabilities to do those sorts of deals.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
What are your thoughts on going bigger or doing something more transformational?
William J. Chase
There\xe2\x80\x99s really not much of a need. At the end of the day our pipeline as it currently stands offers some pretty impressive growth off of our sales base. We have a broad geographic footprint. We are in a 170 different countries. We have got a marketing organization and a development organization that can execute. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the management team. A synergy play isn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly attractive. Could we see tuck in acquisitions, smallest tuck in acquisitions, certainly if one was attractive we have the ability to do it, but a large M&A sort of strategy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really make sense for us.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Scott, lets shift to the pipeline, and I think what\'s \xe2\x80\x93 in my opinion, I think what\'s exciting about AbbVie is that there is a really new pipeline and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that all investors share that opinion yet, and I think that the first opportunity to change that sentiment or that perception is with your Hep C pipeline or your Hep C regimen. But investors really do struggle with your regimen, and how to think about it in the context of competing with Gilead assuming that it hits its optimal profile, which is a one pill once a day regimen showing out 100% cure. So the data that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from you looks really good too in terms of cure rates, but immediately questions around the cumbersome regimen, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s still questions about tolerability, resistance, the bank debt your PI is still Ritonavir boosted, lots of questions. So share with us how we should think about the competitive dynamics and really at the end of the day what are going to be the key selling points. What does an AbbVie sales person say to a gastroenterologist or herpetologist, use mine over theirs?
Scott Brun
Yeah. So, a few things to address there. So, first of all I don\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\x93 we don\xe2\x80\x99t know where the efficacy is ultimately going to fall out. So let me address two cases, I mean one can be the fact that in the harder to treat patients the cirrhotic\xe2\x80\x99s, the no responders that when you really get into large Phase III studies and approximately characterize these rates that the AbbVie regimen looks better than the Gilead and I think given the fact that any clinician and patient we talk to cures came certainly that is going to drive the adoption of the regimen even for what one might think might be relatively small differences in SVR rates, say 5%.
Certainly let\xe2\x80\x99s say that the cure rates look more approximate. I think a large part of the attention on the differences of the regimens have probably overstated just how material those differences are. We are looking at Ribavirin free regimens in Phase III and with that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about three pills in the morning and one at night for 12 weeks.
Certainly what we don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet is whether or not Gilead\xe2\x80\x99s regimen will require Ribavirin certainly in the IM study they\xe2\x80\x99re still continuing on with Ribavirin containing regimens and then that translates that regimen into a BID versus a QD regimen and certainly tends to equate the pill counts. The other thing is we\xe2\x80\x99ve got six Phase III studies in 30 plus countries across the world with over 2200 patients. Based on public disclosures that gives us much greater geographic scope, much greater size of the program and also much greater specificity when you consider that we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually got dedicated studies in cirrhotic patients who really well characterize these hardest to treat patients. So when you look at it that way, I think what we could certainly bring with our numbers even if they\xe2\x80\x99re close is a certainty of a cure with regard to just how confident we are even in the hardest to treat patients that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to provide this level of efficacy.
With regard to the Ritonavir and the drug interactions we are characterizing them. We are going to work very hard to make sure that in a very clear cut fashion that clinicians and patients are educated. This is a very manageable profile particularly when you consider that HIV infected patients will receive Ritonavir boosted regimens for a lifetime on much more complicated polypharmacy. So again we think this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to clearly educate on. So, I want to wait and see exactly what those Phase III results look like, but to your point even if they\xe2\x80\x99re closed I think there are any, any number of different elements that make us confident.
I also want to express the fact that we have a next generation program that is in early clinical development ABT-493 a protease inhibitor, ABT-530 and NS5A inhibitor both with very favorable pharmacologic characteristics neither will need Ritonavir boosting to get to QD dosing, a [pangenatific] activity as well as very interesting resistance characteristics that we think will figure in very well. So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got our vanguard regimen, but we are far from done.
We also have a regimen in Japan which is a genotype Ib market which is two pills once a day 12 weeks no Ribavirin. It\'s using the co-formulation of the PI 450, 267 and Ritonavir. We are also studying that in the west. We\xe2\x80\x99re studying genotype 4, so again when you consider that regimen that mitigates much of the pill count differences and based on our Aviator in genotype 1b we have every expectation this will maintain very high rates. So a long answer, but an important question.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
How is the Phase III enrollment going, and when will we start to see that data readout?
Scott Brun
Yeah. So, let me just say we\xe2\x80\x99re extremely pleased with the way enrollment is going. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at Abbott AbbVie for 16 years; I was involved in HIV development at a time when patients were looking for those therapies. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen things enroll this quickly. Clinicians and patients are seeking out these trials, these therapies. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give specific numbers, but let me just say we\xe2\x80\x99re very pleased with where we are. We are on track from mid 2014 filing. With regard to the data releases because we have six Phase III trials we are trying to determine what the best mode in fashion to release these data are. Certainly a scientific meeting would be preferable.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
What if we got one in November?
Scott Brun
There is that one in November, and we\xe2\x80\x99re looking very closely at all those deadlines to figure out how we want to \xe2\x80\x93 how to approach that. So let me just say, obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of complex decisions with regard to how to approach those releases, we\xe2\x80\x99re working through those very carefully.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Do you think you\xe2\x80\x99re ahead of Gilead? What do you think the time difference is, the gap is between the two companies?
Scott Brun
I don\xe2\x80\x99t want \xe2\x80\x93 I\'ll say that it is a very tight race and like I said we\xe2\x80\x99re executing extremely well and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a very good shot at being first, but its close.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
So just a question on pricing, I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that you\xe2\x80\x99re divulge your pricing plans right here, but given that your hurdle rates for generating a positive ROI on Hep C is likely significantly lower than that for Gilead. Does that influence the way that you think about pricing?
William J. Chase
No, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll think about pricing in this space the way we think about pricing on all of our products. At the end of the day it\'s the value proposition to the payer and we will go through an exercise as we do with all of our products to figure out what is the value of a cure in this market and we will price it in a way that makes it very attractive to the payer along those lines. So, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really think it\'s going to be ROI based, I think that will be a little too narrowly focused. It\'s going to be more externally driven.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
But are you going to price it to gain market share or price it to capture the value of the SVR, which could be comparable to Gilead?
William J. Chase
At the end of the day we think this is a market that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be around for some time. We think this is not going to be the first generation \xe2\x80\x93 the only generation. We think there will be a second generation. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to approach this market very rationally and certainly if we have a clear SVR advantage well that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take into account.
Scott Brun
And I am still not ready to give up that SVR advantage. I mean, again with our 570 patient Aviator study where we looked at two drug regimens, eight week regimens with and without Ribavirin everything performed essentially in the upper 80% or above in the high 90\xe2\x80\x99s in the regimens that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking forward. So I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got tremendous confidence with regard to the robustness of this regimen across a variety of different scenarios be it compliance, be it hard to treat characteristics, and I think we need to be a little careful given that the cohort numbers that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen. I think certainly with Sofosbuvir when you look at the genotype 2, 3 Phase II data versus what ultimately turned out to Phase III for genotype 3, you can see some differences. So, I want to wait too for the Phase III to land and see where we\xe2\x80\x99re at.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Before I move on to the next, are there questions in the audience? So, Scott, also exciting times for you just given the data that we saw at ASCO, let\xe2\x80\x99s start with ABT-199, I certainly was impressed with the response rates that you showed in CLL particularly in comparison to some of the competitors. Can you share with us your view of these assets; its development timeline and again you\xe2\x80\x99re going to come to the market quite a bit after Ibrutinib and some of the other CLL drugs the development. How should we think about the commercial opportunity?
Scott Brun
Yeah, very excited about 199, the first in class PCL inhibitor that essentially turns back on the normal signals that cause cancer cells to die. I think the key here with this drug is as you referred to Jami is the exquisite potency. So, when we looked as we showed at ASCO in patients with relapsed refractory CLL a median of four prior treatment regimens.
We saw overall response rates of 84%, but even more interesting we saw complete response rates which means no microscopic evidence of tumor in the blood, in the marrow and no CT evidence of tumor elsewhere, those complete responses were on the order of 18% which compares very favorably to other investigational agents. So we really think the key here is; how do you leverage that exquisite potency? When you look at drugs like Ibrutinib, it appears in all likelihood that they will have to be used as chronic maintenance.
Now the question is, with 199 could you perhaps treat for a certain discreet period of time and then stop and result in a remission or even a functional cure? And we based this on part that when you\xe2\x80\x99re looking beyond complete response there\xe2\x80\x99s something called minimal residual disease which are using molecular diagnostic techniques to say, is there any evidence of tumor in the blood or the marrow at a 1 in 10,000 prevalence of cell. Now probably at least half of our patients were receiving \xe2\x80\x93 were achieving complete response are also getting MRD.
So we see tremendous opportunity even though Ibrutinib maybe ahead of really transforming the way CLL was being treated and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking to Genentech about, how do you approach this? Do you do it in certain combinations in first line? How long do you treat for? But to your point our registration strategy is what; we\xe2\x80\x99ve got good data very strong data into relapsed refractory including the hardest to treat 17p deleted patients who responded just as well as the rest of the patients. So we\xe2\x80\x99re going forward with two studies in relapsed refractory CLL.
The first is going to be a large single agent 199 single arm study in the 17p deleted patients who have the highest unmet medical need and that study is getting underway imminently. The second study is a more traditional Phase III design, all-comer relapsed remitting, looking at 199 plus Rituxan a chemotherapy free regimen compared to Bendamustine Rituxan a standard chemo regimen, and powered for superiority on progression free survival. So, certainly when you look at these programs there is a potential for market place entry in 2016.

And are there other tumor types that you\xe2\x80\x99re exploring or other hematological cancers?
Scott Brun
Absolutely, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got ongoing programs in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We\xe2\x80\x99re looking at multiple myeloma. We are exploring mantle cell, diffuse large B-cell, starting to consider other malignancies like Waldenstrom\'s and then one with the question is also is, could you potentially move B-cell into certain solid tumor types. But first we\xe2\x80\x99re going to really well characterize on these human logic side; so lot of potential.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Do you feel that you\xe2\x80\x99re out of the woods on the tumor lysis syndrome issue?
Scott Brun
I never like to say out of the woods with an ongoing program, but what I will say is that we have come up with a protocol we feel very comfortable with in order to control and avoid the presence of the occurrence of tumor lysis syndrome. We are starting with a lower dose, a 20mg dose. We are increasing dose a bit more slowly and we have enhanced monitoring and prophylactic measures in place. The TLS again is really a consequence of the very rapid tumor killing which when cells die and they release their contents can be damaging to other organ system. So all of our trials are back up and running. We are collecting data, but I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling good that the way we\xe2\x80\x99re approaching this is going to allow this to be managed as to our advisors.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
I think this summer you\xe2\x80\x99re presenting data at the Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s Conference for your cognitive enhancer drug. Can you talk about that a little bit, I mean, this is sort of less sexy field of cognitive enhancement versus disease modification, but also a lot less risky.
Scott Brun
Yeah. We have got programs in disease modification that are a bit farther \xe2\x80\x93 early on the pipeline. But ABT-126, is an alpha 7 nicotinic neuronal receptor agonist that helps to enhance levels of acetylcholine in parts of the brain that are most associated with cognition and memory. We are exploring it both as you said in Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease. We are currently in Phase 2b looking at it head to head versus Aricept as well as an add-on to Aricept in mild to moderate Alzheimer\'s.
We\'re also looking at it in cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. So we have proof of concept trials in both of those indications that warrant us moving into Phase 2b, which will support the potential for Phase 3 initiation in 2014. What you will see in July are the initial proof of concept data in mild to moderate Alzheimer\'s as a single agent compared to Aricept at the lower end of the dose range related to what we are currently studying in Phase 2.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
And have you made a decision to move into Phase 3 already or are you waiting for it?
Scott Brun
We have got some additional data that needs to come out from the Phase 2b that will be coming out early next year that allows to make \xe2\x80\xa6
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
So the data we see this summer is not necessarily the optimal dosing regimen?
Scott Brun
No, it is not. It is again a proof of concept that gave us sufficient confidence to move into the current Phase 2b comprehensive add-on in monotherapy program at a broader dose range.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Got it. Well, unfortunately we ran out of time and I only have 15 more questions on your pipeline, but we have to wait until next year I think.
Scott Brun
Are we going to keep going \xe2\x80\x93 going for ever.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much.
Scott Brun
Thank you, Jami.
William J. Chase
Thank you very much Jami.
