Good morning. My name is Anthony and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Aetna Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a remainder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn your conference over to Mr. Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cowhey, please go ahead.
Thomas Cowhey
Good morning and thank you for joining Aetna\'s third quarter 2014 earnings call and webcast. This is Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna. And with me this morning are Aetna\'s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Mark Bertolini; and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks, we will answer your questions.
During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning\'s press release and the reports we file with the SEC, including our 2013 Form 10-K. We have provided reconciliations of metrics related to the company\'s performance that are non-GAAP measures in our third quarter 2014 financial supplement and our updated 2014 guidance summary. Copies of which are available on the Investor Information section of Aetna.com.
We would also like to invite investors to mark their calendars for Aetna\xe2\x80\x99s 2014 Investor Conference, which will be held in New York City on December 11. Invitations for this limited attendance event will be sent shortly, and for those unable to attend in person, a webcast will be available. Finally, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in non-public forums is limited. So we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?
Mark T. Bertolini
Good morning. Thank you Tom and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we\xe2\x80\x99ve reported operating earnings per share of $1.79, well ahead of both analyst estimates and our previous projections.
Today, for the third time in as many quarters, we are also raising our 2014 operating EPS projection to a range of $6.60 to $6.70. At the midpoint this guidance represents nearly 7% year-over-year operating EPS growth and a 15% CAGR since 2010. And this performance will be good for a normal year. But to achieve this success in 2014, a year that many thought would spell the death of our industry, is a testament to the power of our strategy and the strength of our diversified portfolio as we seek ways to better serve our customers and create shareholder value through this period of significant change.
In the face of unprecedented change for our industry, our third quarter results position us to have a very good year. We grew medical membership by 470,000 members, achieving a record of approximately 23.6 million members. We grew quarterly operating revenue to a record $14.7 billion, a 13% increase from the prior year. We delivered 7.8% pretax operating margin, putting Aetna on track to achieve high single-digit operating margins again in 2014 and we continue to generate substantial free cash flow and aggressively deploy excess capital, returning over $1.2 billion to shareholders year-to-date.
As we reflect on our year-to-date performance, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to revisit some of the challenges we face this year, including pricing solving for nearly $1 billion in ACA related industry fees and taxes, solving for the largest rate cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in our recent history, navigating a host of new regulatory requirements in our small group and individual businesses, managing through a turbulent launch in public exchanges and controlling pharmacy costs in a year where heavy priced Hepatitis C treatments first became available and treatment guidelines changed in unforeseen ways.
Aetna\xe2\x80\x99s diversified portfolio continues to exceed our expectations in meeting these challenges. Our Government business, which now represents over 40% of our health premiums, is having a stand out year. Medicare continues to deliver in phase of a tough rate environment, strong execution in closing the 2014 funding gap and the corrective actions that we took last year to fix our underperforming Medicare businesses have resulted in higher than projected Medicare contributions.
Further, our year-to-date results put us on a path to have another excellent year in 2015. Finally, the recently released Medicare star ratings for the 2016 plan year were 79% of our current membership in plans rated four stars or greater, holds well for our future success. Medicaid continues to be another bright spot in the Aetna portfolio led by continued strong performance in our Kentucky Medicaid business. Medicaid membership and revenue growth also continue to be robust, ranging from our new contract in Illinois that went live on October 1st, our dual-eligible contracts in Ohio and Illinois, and continued growth in expansion lives. Group insurance which pressured earnings last year continues to post solid results in excess of our projections, driven by a favorable underwriting performance in our life insurance and disability products.
Finally, Coventry synergies continue to accelerate. We now project that we will achieve $0.60 per share of accretion from Coventry this year at the high-end of our $0.55 to $0.60 range and we have increased confidence in our $0.90 per share 2015 accretion goals. Well, we are quite pleased with our progress in achieving cost synergies and accretion from this transaction. We would note that there are other strategic and financial benefits that we have not quantified in our estimates. For example, we have not tallied the benefit of Medicare advantage revenue enhancement and star rating synergies that can be directly going to be influenced by Coventry\xe2\x80\x99s Medicare franchise.
Aetna\xe2\x80\x99s commercial business performance has also been quite strong with many of our businesses meeting or exceeding their projected contributions. Our fee-based businesses are having an excellent year. We have grown ASC membership by over 700,000 members\xe2\x80\x99 year-to-date and are exceeding our profit projections. From an overall perspective, our commercial risk business is performing well, notwithstanding the fact that we increased our outlook for the full year Commercial MBR. Our launch group commercial businesses are performing quite well and are meeting our year-to-date projections and our action plans to address pressures in our international and student health businesses have made excellent progress. As price increases in the international in a combination of pricing and other actions in student health have improved performance.
However, performance observed in the third quarter in the small end of our middle market business and premium accruals in our ACA compliant blocks of business caused us to prudently increase our full year 2014 Commercial MBR projections this morning to approximately 80%. Shawn will address our analysis of these commercial businesses and our action plans in greater detail. But we will remain quite pleased with the performance of our aggregate portfolio and our confident that this modest portion of the commercial business portfolio will not be a headwind to Aetna achieving its 2015 earnings goals.
As we look to 2015, we continue to believe we have the right strategy to drive growth and create long-term value for our shareholders. Our goal is growth both operating earnings and operating EPS every year and we believe we can achieve these goals in 2015. We plan on providing specific guidance for 2015 at our Investor Conference on December 11.
In summary, I am pleased with our results year-to-date and I am confident in our strategic direction and our ability to continue to execute, our ability to achieve Coventry synergies and our accretion goals, the power of our diversified portfolio to drive consistent and sustainable growth, our revised 2014 operating EPS projection of $6.60 to $6.70 per share, and our ability to grow operating earnings and operating EPS in 2015. I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers by focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers, and generating and deploying capital responsibility. We believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our third quarter results, our updated 2014 outlook, and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2015. Shawn?
Shawn M. Guertin
Thank you Mark and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we\xe2\x80\x99ve reported third quarter 2014 operating earnings per share of $1.79, an 11% increase over the prior year quarter. Our year-to-date results are ahead of both our previous projections and analyst consensus estimates and as a result, we raised our 2014 operating EPS projection again this morning. Aetna\'s operating results continue to be supported by strong operating fundamentals as evidenced by double-digit revenue growth, robust cash flow, healthy balance sheet metrics and achievement of target operating margins.
I\'ll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our top-line performance continues to be very strong. We grew medical membership to a record of approximately 23.6 million members, adding 470,000 new members during the quarter, with growth in our Commercial ASC and Government businesses. The third quarter of 2014 represents Aetna\'s 10th consecutive quarter of medical membership growth. Our strong membership gains help to drive 13% operating revenue growth over the prior year quarter, achieving a record quarterly level of $14.7 billion. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our third quarter total Medical Benefit Ratio was 82.3%, a good overall result and an 80 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter.
Our operating expense ratio increased from the same period last year to 18.2%; however, excluding ACA fees from more expenses, our operating expense ratio went down by 70 basis points from the prior year quarter. This outstanding result was driven by fixed cost leverage as a result of our strong top line growth, Coventry synergies, and disciplined expense management. Our pre-tax operating margin was 7.8% consistent with our target operating margin range putting Aetna on track to achieve high single-digit operating margins in 2014. This result would represent Aetna\'s fifth consecutive year of achieving or exceeding this goal despite an increasing mix of lower margin government and public exchange revenue. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to second quarter 2014 dates of service.
Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days claims payable were approximately 50 days at the end of the quarter, up just over two days sequentially and higher by four days year-over-year. One of the primary drivers of this increase is our increased government revenue inside the quarter, particularly from high equity duals membership. We project this metric to return to a level more consistent with our recent historical experience over time.
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. On a year-to-date basis, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.7x operating earnings. We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing over 3 million shares in the quarter for $255 million and distributing approximately $80 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. We are quite pleased with our third quarter results, which we believe demonstrate the execution of Aetna\'s growth strategy, the success of the Coventry integration, and the value of our diversified portfolio.
I will now discuss the key drivers of our third quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business, our commercial membership grew by 390,000 members during the quarter, driven primarily by the addition of the TRS active care members, partially offset by declines in our commercial risk membership, and in-group attrition in our large group ASC membership. Our Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio was 81% for the quarter and 79.6% year-to-date, a good absolute result but higher than anticipated in our previous projections. For the full-year, we\xe2\x80\x99re now projecting that our Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio will be approximately 80%.
The change in our full year Commercial MBR outlook is primarily driven by three items. The first item is the performance of our smaller middle market business, groups with 51 to 300 employees which represent approximately 20% of our total commercial premiums. The second item is our individual business, where we have maintained a cautious posture all year and have maintained that posture in the third quarter, as we recorded our estimates for risk adjustors and risk corridors for the first time.
Finally, the third item is a prudent assumption of seasonally higher medical costs in the fourth quarter of this year. Let me walk you through these items in more detail. With respect to our smaller middle-market business, late in the third quarter as second quarter and early third quarter medical costs became more complete. Medical costs experienced almost higher than previously projected. As we examine this block of business in more detail, our analysis suggests that the impact of cost management initiatives, including benefit plan and network design changes, price into certain products have not had the desired impact on medical cost strengths for these populations.
Consequently, overall trend yield spread on this block are lower than previously projected. To address this emerging experience, which to be clear has not manifested itself in our larger experienced rated accounts, we have aggressively implemented pricing actions. First and foremost Aetna\xe2\x80\x99s forward pricing strategy remains consistent with prior years, favor in margin over membership and incorporating 50 basis to 100 basis points of increased commercial medical cost trend in our 2015 pricing formulas. Second, in September as we began to see lower than projected trend yield spread emerged, we took pricing actions on the affected businesses for 2015.
And finally, in October, we also took broader based pricing actions under remaining unpriced 2015 member months in our commercial business to further mitigate the impact of this emerging experience. We believe the performance of this specific block will improve in 2015 and should not serve as a barrier to achieving our 2015 goals.
Moving onto our ACA compliant blocks of business, based on our most up-to-date data and forecasting, we did make accruals related to each of the three hours this quarter, specifically we recorded $110 million of incremental re-insurance recoverable during the quarter, bring our total for the year to $162 million. We expect that the full-year accruals for re-insurance could exceed $320 million in 2014. Additionally for the first time this year, we recorded a net payable of $97 million related to the risk adjustors and risk corridors for our ACA compliant individual and small group policies. The booking of this net payable resulted in approximately 50 basis points of incremental commercial MBR pressure in the quarter, relative to our previous projections.
We\xe2\x80\x99ve maintained a cautious posture on this business all year and we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s prudent to continue to do so in the first year of this new and still largely immature program. To conclude on the Commercial MBR, I thought it would be useful to summarize the drivers of our change in our annual guidance. Based on the medical cost experience in our smaller middle market business this quarter, we have raised our 2014 Commercial MBR projections by approximately 50 basis points. To address premium approvals in our ACA compliance blocks of business this quarter and for the remainder of the year, we have lowered our premium yield assumptions increasing the Commercial MBR by approximately 25 basis points, and additionally we have assumed our Commercial MBR could increase by up to 25 basis points for the full year, based on a prudent assumption of seasonally higher medical cost in the fourth quarter of this year.
Stepping back, we continue to believe that aggregate commercial medical cost trend increases remain moderate. We continue to actively examine our experience for an uptick in utilization with a specific eye towards the newly approved all oral Hepatitis C treatments approved earlier this month.
We also continue to closely monitor the outpatient category, particularly emergency department usage. As we noted in September, the pharmacy category remains pressured and the outpatient category continuous to run towards the high-end of our projected range. But our in-patient, physician, and ancillary categories remain well-behaved. Based on our year-to-date experience and revised full year outlook, we currently projected that Aetna\xe2\x80\x99s standalone 2014 commercial medical cost trend will now be in the middle to upper-end of our original projected range of 6% to 7%. The change in this metric relative to our previous projections is primarily related to the performance of our smaller middle market business.
Moving on from commercial, our government franchise is another important growth lever for our business. Government is having a truly outstanding year, from both a growth and a profitability standpoint and now represents over 40% of our medical premiums. Our government business grew by 80,000 members in the quarter, consisting of: Medicare Advantage growth of 22,000 members; Medicare Supplement growth of 14,000 members; and Medicaid growth of 44,000 members, primarily from ACA related expansion and approximately 5,000 dual eligible members related to our participation in the Ohio and Illinois demonstration projects.
Aetna\xe2\x80\x99s strong government membership growth drove third quarter government premiums to a record $5.3 billion, a 19% increase over the prior-year period. Our Government Medical Benefit Ratio was 84% in the quarter, an excellent result in absolute terms and better than our previous projections. Drivers of this excellent performance include the success of actions designed to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap and continuing strong performance in our Medicaid business including in Kentucky.
Turning to the balance sheet; our financial position, capital structure, and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At September 30th, we had a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 35%. Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $252 million. We repurchased over 3 million shares for $255 million and paid a shareholder dividend of approximately $80 million. After other sources, we ended the quarter with $100 million of cash at the parent, representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 351.7 million shares at September 30.
As a result of our third quarter performance for the third time and as many quarters, we are increasing our full-year 2014 operating earnings per share projections to a range of $6.60 to $6.70 per share, up from our previous guidance of $6.45 to $6.60 per share. This increased guidance range of the testament to the strength of our diversified portfolio and reflects strong performance in our government, fee-based, and group insurance businesses along with strong cost controls and increased accretion from the Coventry acquisition, which more than offset to specific performance items in our commercial insured business.
Our updated 2014 projections are also influenced by the following additional drivers. We continue to project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23.4 million members, a decrease of 200,000 members over the remainder of the year. This projected decrease is primarily related to projected declines in our individual business both on and off public exchanges. Based on our full-year membership projections and year-to-date results, we now project that our full-year 2014 operating revenue will be between $57 billion and $58 billion. As discussed, we now project our Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio will be approximately 80% for the full-year.
Based on our strong year-to-date performance across our government businesses, we now project our full-year Government Medical Benefit Ratio will be approximately 85% to 85.5% with [buyers] (ph) towards the bottom of this revised range. We now project our operating expense ratio will be less than 18.5% based on achievement of Coventry synergies and strong cost controls. It should be noted that a portion of our third quarter expense favorability is related to timing of spend, which will partially reverse in the fourth quarter.
We continue to project our pre-tax operating margin to be approximately 7.5% consistent with our high single-digit target. Consistent with our revised operating EPS range, we now project operating earnings to be approximately $2.4 billion. We continue to project net dividends from subsidiaries between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion with excess cash flow to the parent between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. Based on our year-to-date share repurchases, we now project full-year weighted average share count to be at the low end of our previously projected range of 359 million to 360 million shares.
As you know, we do not typically provide forward your guidance on our third quarter call and we will not be providing specific 2015 guidance today. However, I wanted to offer you some insight into the major items that influenced our preliminary view of that just 2015 earnings power and give us confidence that we will be able to grow both operating earnings and operating EPS next year. As we complete our forecasting process for next year, we are incorporating a number of challenges into our preliminary view of 2015 including the projected impact of prior year\xe2\x80\x99s reserve development that we do not as a matter of course include in forward guidance.
The projected return to more normalized margins in our Medicaid business after the outperformance we experienced in 2014 and a modest headwind from exiting our Delaware Medicaid contract. The projected margin reset in our Group Insurance segment given the strong outperformance we experienced in 2014 and the risk that we will be unable to collect 100% of the increase in the health insurer fee including the necessary tax growth across all of our lines of business in 2015. We would also note several opportunities including the projected impacts of incremental Coventry synergies as we continue to work to achieve or exceed our stated goal of $0.90 of accretion in 2015. The prospects for Medicare margin expansion as we benefit from the investments that we have made in our Medicare Advantage business.
Fixed cost leverage as we continue to grow revenue and actively manage costs, up to $1 billion in share repurchases in 2015 and the prospect for growth and margin improvement in our individual business particularly in our declining of exchange membership base, which is driving losses in our overall individual business in 2014. In working through our preliminary view, we also considered the potential impact of our forward pricing strategy. Specifically consistent with past practice, our 2014 pricing contemplates a 50 basis points to 100 basis points increase in utilization in addition to the specific pricing actions we discussed earlier.
We believe this prudent pricing pasture that favors margin over membership, should largely mitigate the recent Commercial MBR performance in our smaller middle market businesses.
In closing, we are pleased with the strength of our third quarter and year-to-date results and our improved 2014 outlook, which at the midpoint represent 7% operating EPS growth, in spite of the many challenges facing our industry in 2014. As we continue to execute during this challenging time for our industry, we are confident that we can achieve our increased 2014 projections and are well-positioned for a successful 2015.
I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?

\n', b'
Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. (Operator Instruction) Operator, the first question please.
Operator
We\xe2\x80\x99ll take our first questions from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.
Justin Lake \xe2\x80\x93 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
\n', b'
Thanks. Good morning. So one question would be focus on that 51 book to 300 book. By my math it\xe2\x80\x99s coming out to \xe2\x80\x93 it sounds like that book is up 500 basis points higher than you expected, just kind of looking through the impact you\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out here. So, if that\xe2\x80\x99s so, can you flush out some of the details around the product changes, the medical management initiatives that you had expected to moderate trends this year in that book? And what went wrong looking back? And then, can you lay out how much of this you were able to price back for next year? How much of this renews for one-one, how much you catch and when? All those details, so we can kind of understand the headwind into the next year. Thanks.
Mark T. Bertolini
Thanks, Justin. This is Mark. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give a broader outlook and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll have Shawn talk a bit about the numbers. I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing with this book of business is the transition as we move into the Affordable Care Act and then transition of the 51 book to 100 book, particularly book of business moving into small group over time and having to be ACA complaint. There is a lot of noise in this book and in this segment relative to changes in the ACA regulation on the flag, keep what you have, early enrollments. And so we think a lot of it was related to the sort of (indiscernible) and the noise around all the things that were changing at the latter part of last year. But we did realize we were having a problem as we\xe2\x80\x99re moving through the year and this book of business. And we did take pricing actions, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll have Shawn give you a little more detail on.
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes. So, Justin let me start out and just make sure I level set for sort of everybody\xe2\x80\x99s benefit. While this 51 book to 300 book issue has manifested itself in higher medical cost trend versus our prior projections, we do not believe that it is a broad based movement in medical cost trend, but rather the difference between some assumptions we made in pricing and then what has ultimately emerged in the experience. So, to your question, we made \xe2\x80\x93 there are a number of things that we certainly have done in this block, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at a network of providers that are smaller and higher quality to drive lower cost. We\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at a lot of benefit plan changes. We always have a host of medical management type initiatives sort of the trend vendors that people talk about. All of those things tend to have both, sort of a pair of medic effect of getting higher co-pays, for example, lower unit cost, but they also tend to have a behavioral effect as well.
And so, the ability to always predict precisely what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do is an estimate. And at the end of the day we made some of those forward assumptions in the pricing of this block and as of yet we have not seen sort of the consequence medical cost savings. So that really is sort of a background on that in terms of that. In terms of pricing, and I think this is really the important part of this. As soon as we saw this, we took very aggressive action. So in September we acted on the affected block and put price increase and that would capture somewhere on the order of two-thirds of that block. And so keep in mind, this is smaller business. So there is both less lead time and a little more rate flexibility than we have on either large group or small group.
In addition to that, in October we took more broad based pricing action on our whole book to try to make up for the gap. Those two things right there would produce 60 bps to 65 bps of fix next year. And as we mentioned in the remarks, there are certainly other levers that we potentially have here like our forward pricing strategy, selected action on other blocks of business in the medical cost lever.
Justin Lake \xe2\x80\x93 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
So, Shawn, just to be clear that 65 basis points to 70 basis points of impact is relative to what would be \xe2\x80\x93 you said 50 basis points to this year, but only in the back half of the 100 basis points. So you got maybe that two-thirds essentially, but you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that\xe2\x80\x99s before the 50 basis points to 100 basis point of just pricing op for typical conservatism. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way that is operated?
Shawn M. Guertin
It is right, but let me be really clear about this, right. So there\xe2\x80\x99s 50 basis points of pressure, but as I mentioned in my remarks, this really began to emerge as we looked at how second quarter developed. So it really is a sort of three quarter effect if you will. So if you want to take the 50 basis points and say what kind of issue is that carrying into 2015, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably 60 basis points to 75 basis points. Those two actions that I described probably get you 60 to 65 and I\xe2\x80\x99m not counting anything from the forward pricing strategy or any other lever in there other than those two.
Justin Lake \xe2\x80\x93 JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Josh Raskin \xe2\x80\x93 Barclays
\n', b'
Great, thanks. I hate to do, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stick on the same topic, so I guess my question is, you guys seems to think this is indicative of expectations, reality versus sort of expectations \xe2\x80\x93 last year you talked about an expectation and I understand that the broad book of business where you see, an uptick in utilization I was expected in pricing, you price for that. And then it sounds like for this specific book were you expecting some of your medical management efforts to actually, reduce medical cost and that\xe2\x80\x99s just not materializing or you actually seeing an increase in cost I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m just confused as to what exactly changed and what were you thinking coming into the year?
Mark T. Bertolini
I think it\xe2\x80\x99s coming into the year, we\xe2\x80\x99re thinking that the lower end of this block the 51 to 100, Josh was going to transition and move to more like small group into our narrow network models. But as we got into early renewal keep what you have, shop exchange is not coming up, we start to see pressures to move back the products that I already had, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s in that early renewal strategy that our pricing wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as pinpoint as it could be on that block.
Josh Raskin \xe2\x80\x93 Barclays
I was just going to say, you sounds like your expectations are on that specific book of business that they were going to move into small group products that tend to run lower MLRs they stayed in existing ones that have higher MLRs?
\n', b'
Mark T. Bertolini
I think that was part of the noise in the process, so we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get as much movement narrow networks, there is much movement toward the medical management programs we wanted to see. And so, the mix of business was different than we initially price for.
Josh Raskin \xe2\x80\x93 Barclays
Got it, and then just one quick one the prior period reserve development, I know some of that related to 2Q. So how much is the total, I know you guys don\xe2\x80\x99t project that but what is that you know, as you looked it as a challenge shown on the prior periods development in 2014 that would not be expected in guidance for 2015.
Mark T. Bertolini
I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about that being in the neighborhood of about $0.40 this year through the third quarter.
Josh Raskin \xe2\x80\x93 Barclays
Perfect, thanks.

Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter Costa \xe2\x80\x93 Wells Fargo Securities
Hi, just to be clear, the pressure on that mid-market, small mid-market group, are those in Grandfathered plans now that would \xe2\x80\x93 because you said that they were early renewals, so they are non ACA compliance or the Grandfathered, these plans would have, members would have to stay with you, (indiscernible) prices.

Shawn M. Guertin
\n', b'
No. Peter, this business actually isn\xe2\x80\x99t subject to that at all, it\xe2\x80\x99s 51 to 300. So it\xe2\x80\x99s not sort of the classic small group 2 to 50. One of the references is that Mark made is that the sort of sub-segment of that that\xe2\x80\x99s 50 to 100 will eventually have to become ACA compliant in 2016. And as a result of that I think a lot of other things in this space as Mark mentioned, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot more turbulence in this sort of book in terms of plan change, renewals, new business and things like that. But the 51 to 300 block itself is not a block that subject to sort of the ACA compliance.
Peter Costa \xe2\x80\x93 Wells Fargo Securities
Okay and then just talking about the overall price increases, you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about 50 to 100 basis point of higher utilization expected, so that\xe2\x80\x99s added on top of I guess the 150 to 200 basis points, if you had in the 6% to 7% cost trend this year, is that accurate, or is it \xe2\x80\x93 are you lowering the view on utilization?
Shawn M. Guertin
No, it would be 50 to 100 basis points up from our view for this year, which we now or I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in the middle to the high-end of our previous range of 6% to 7%.
Peter Costa \xe2\x80\x93 Wells Fargo Securities
So if we add that to what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on for unit cost, you are being sort of the 6.5% to 7% \xe2\x80\x93 7.5%, view on cost trend for next year, is that accurate or is there some other math that should be factored in there?
Shawn M. Guertin
I think, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to put too fine a point on it yet for that, but I would think about it is more cleanly as we would always try to sort of manage unit cost increases to not be accelerating, maybe we could make a little bit at in-roads. But I think for the purpose of your question and I think where you\xe2\x80\x99re going with it, it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to think about the 50 to 100 basis points being on top of sort of the 6.5% to 7% that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about now.
Peter Costa \xe2\x80\x93 Wells Fargo Securities
Okay, and then, in terms of just to finalize, you talked about additional pricing actions on top of that that were implemented beyond that 50 to 100, so how much more beyond that, is that the 60 to 65 Bips that you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about?
Shawn M. Guertin
Correct.
Peter Costa \xe2\x80\x93 Wells Fargo Securities
Okay thank you.

Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin Fischbeck \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay thanks. I wanted to ask about your commentary about the headwinds sort of next year you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned the returned in old margin the Medicaid after that performance in 2014. I wanted to understand what the mechanism was for that, are you expecting rate cuts, I know that the expansion of the population generally has come in well with our states, going back and looking at the rates for next year. Why would you expect to return?
Mark T. Bertolini
We have some renewal states next year that we will need to negotiate. And as we negotiate they look at the underlying trends in that book and what\xe2\x80\x99s they can afford. We know we have a new rate coming in Kentucky in July next year, so that will set a different benchmark, as well. So that will put pressure on the margins we have in Medicaid. In addition we have tools that are coming in through the latter half of this year and in the next year, and that will pressure, because we book conservatively our duals membership revenue of medical costs.
Kevin Fischbeck \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. So, you include duals on your Medicaid commentary?
Mark T. Bertolini
We do. Correct.
Kevin Fischbeck \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. And then just one other quick question, the Q4 commentary, you said that part of the guidance on MLR was a conservative view about seasonality into Q4. I guess, you\xe2\x80\x99ve always probably would have assume seasonality into Q4, something you can do and something different now with your guidance, I just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure? What exactly that was referring to?
Mark T. Bertolini
Really it is pretty straight forward, what it is, is just an assumption that we might see a little bit more incremental seasonality in Q4 then was inherent in our prior predictions and we\xe2\x80\x99ve banded that at anywhere from zero to 20 \xe2\x80\x93 up to 25 bips which the 25 bips for the full year would be about 100 basis points right in a quarter. So it\xe2\x80\x99s really just making greater provision for the seasonal uptick in the fourth quarter, than existed in our prior projections.
Kevin Fischbeck \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I guess, probably given some of the commentary on this call, people little bit worried about trend rising. So how do we think about, you provisioning more for seasonality in the Q4 versus an assumption that trend is accelerating, how do you differentiate that is those two points in your mind?
Mark T. Bertolini
It\xe2\x80\x99s a larger group of HICs membership, which there detectable et cetera to reset at the beginning of the year. So we have that book of business, which is maturing through the year remember we had a lot of growth in April and May in the later part of that enrollment period. So we are just being prudent and are thinking about how the fourth quarter is going to develop given ex-membership.
Shawn M. Guertin
Yeah. Kevin I\xe2\x80\x99d go back to the point of my statement about does not appearing to be broad base. So I would not read that into what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with seasonality I would read it more into making a prudent provision for this metric in the fourth quarter. And again I reiterate part of the reason we see that is our large group business is performing with expectations and in someway that is the most trend evident business we have, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s largely priced on that customer\xe2\x80\x99s experience in a trend assumption.
And that business is performing very well. And as I mentioned, other than the categories I mentioned in the third quarter around outpatient in Hep C most of the other categories are very well-behaved in consistent with our expectation.
So that is not certainly was not the intent of making that provision and again I would reiterate that when we look at the data today does not appeared that\xe2\x80\x99s happening across our book
Kevin Fischbeck \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. That makes sense. So that is really just a specific part of the book that you\xe2\x80\x99re clearly more for that detectable part of the book, it\xe2\x80\x99s a seasonality comes on it.
\n', b'
Mark T. Bertolini

Yes, I mean that\xe2\x80\x99s what creates the seasonal affect on earnings.

Our next question comes from Tom Carrol with Stifel.
Thomas Carroll \xe2\x80\x93 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.
\n', b'
Hey, good morning. I wonder if you would comment a bit more on the three [oars] (ph) that you had in your prepared remarks. I think you said there was a $97 million payable for individual and small group. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get a sense of the process that you go through at this point to build out that number and I can\xe2\x80\x99t determine what kind of conservatism is built into that. And then, secondly, I was wondering if you would quantify the PPD amount that you would like us to exclude as we think about 2015?
Mark T. Bertolini
\n', b'
Okay. On the latter, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same $0.40 that I referenced before. I think it might have been Josh who asked that question remember, but about $0.40, Tom. So, as you know, we have been accruing for reinsurance all along and that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clean accrual and that is based on known claims. So it\xe2\x80\x99s really these other two [oars] (ph), which we haven\xe2\x80\x99t accrued for up until now.
I think most of you know that we do not get any official data from the government to do this calculation. And so, we are relying on a consultant who is getting the data from as many payers as they can in these markets, so that we can get a better assessment of where our risk profile stands versus the average. You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear people refer to that as the weekly data. So we have that data and we got that actually very late in September. And I would tell you that looking at the data we know it\xe2\x80\x99s not perfect. And, so to some degree we had to exercise some judgment in what we saw in there.
And for example, we know not every payer is in there, and so a simple example of why it\xe2\x80\x99s not perfect. When we look at that data, it became fairly evident to me that we are going to be in a risk adjuster payable position. And so, I thought it made sense and I thought we could certainly make a reasonable estimate of then what that risk adjuster payable would be applying some judgment to the data and then running back through the rest of the formula. The net of that is this sort of $97 million payable that we have.
In terms of I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate with such (indiscernible) on the amount of conservativism in there. But as I mentioned we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a cautious tack on this all year. And I think in arriving at our estimate of the $97 million, we maintain that posture as we analyze that data and applied our judgment to it.
Thomas Carroll \xe2\x80\x93 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.
So is that turns out to be too conservative that would flow back through the income statement at some point, presumably in 2015. Would that look like \xe2\x80\x93 would you package that with PPD or would it be a separate process that you would communicate to us?
Mark T. Bertolini
It\xe2\x80\x99s really a revenue item and I think in our Q, we were disclosing the net amount, so I think it would be apparent, but you have a very good point, which is I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that this data is going to be so far advanced for the fourth quarter that we\xe2\x80\x99re still not going to have to take a bit of a cautious pasture here. So probably will be into next year when we start to get a little bit more clarity or precision rather to this particular estimate.
Thomas Carroll \xe2\x80\x93 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.

Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse
Thanks good morning. First just to following out on the exchanges maybe broadly \xe2\x80\x93 can you give us a sense of where you stand on margins for the exchange book at this point?
Mark T. Bertolini
Specifically, let me be clear about this. On our overall individual block, which is both on and off exchange business, we have a modest loss year-to-date and would be projecting a modest loss for the full-year. As this is emerging, we are losing money as I mentioned in my prepared remarks on the off exchange business and making a modest amount of money on the on exchange business. That\xe2\x80\x99s really driven more by the fixed cost leverage because we got more membership then we thought as opposed to sort of get the underwriting performance is a lot better than expected in fact the MBR, we\xe2\x80\x99re probably still booking at a little bit worse than we might have expected on a year-to-date basis, but we are getting some leverage.
So overall individual is a loss year-to-date and a loss for the year, the HIF is sort of marginally profitable and then we\xe2\x80\x99re losing on the off. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the point I was making in my prepared remarks, which is we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing keep what you have on that off exchange business. So that business will either decide to leave us or by one of our ACA compliant plans in which case generally those plans are at a higher premium level than the current premium rates in place. So we think both either one of those developments will serve to sort of improve the picture in 2015 as opposed to 2014 on this business.
Ralph Giacobbe \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse
Okay, all right. That\xe2\x80\x99s helpful. And then maybe could you just breakout commercial trend for inpatient versus outpatient book and at this point when you look at sort of the hospital spend, can you just remind us what percentage is inpatient versus outpatient? Thanks.
Shawn M. Guertin
Inpatient is 25%, outpatient is 15%. Yeah, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change again most of we said impatient and all would be mid-to-high singles really driven more by unit cost outpatient is at the high-end of that high single digit range and the other\xe2\x80\x99s physician has been mid-single and that\xe2\x80\x99s behaving well, so again all the other categories really other than outpatient and pharmacy sort of Hep C driven are pretty much sort of right in the range of where we thought this year.
Ralph Giacobbe \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse

Our next question comes from Christine Arnold, Cowen and Company.
Christine Arnold \xe2\x80\x93 Cowen and Company
Hi there. As I think about Medicare versus Medicaid performance year to-date this year versus next year on that broad level, I understand that Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s outperformance the new rate may not continue second half of next year, how are you looking and you did mention that Medicare Advantage margins could improve, could you help me think about kind of the Medicaid headwind versus the Medicare Advantage tailwind, and how do you? What do you see driving that Medicare Advantage tailwind? Is it membership growth, is it margin or is it both?
Mark T. Bertolini
On Medicare it is both, I would expect that we would grow membership next year and I would expect sort of given some of the revenue things we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing around stars and risk adjusted revenue and the improvements we\xe2\x80\x99ve made in that process, that will give us an opportunity to expand the margin in that business after a year or that was virtually impossible obviously to do given the rate cut.
The Medicaid that headwind is exactly the one you\xe2\x80\x99ve referenced in the previous person questioned about that will largely have to deal with rate reset throughout 2015 and I think your point on Kentucky is a good one which is that the rates do not reset there until July 1 of next year, so that is a back half issue for us. And as mark mentioned, the performance of these new high acuity populations and how that would play out, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into sort of quantifying these with specificity right now, but those are the big drivers.
Shawn M. Guertin
I would note Christine that this all relative to the rate for 2015 the Medicare Advantage is much smaller than it was last year we were 800 basis points last year were less than 200 basis points this year.
Christine Arnold \xe2\x80\x93 Cowen and Company
And then (indiscernible) quarter that you have booked any of these quarters to offset the risk adjuster payable?
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes, we are in a risk adjuster payable position and when you run that through the math we then get a risk corridor receivable. I actually think the net number here because the two are very interrelated the net number here is the right number to think about and especially given some of the judgment that we had to apply with the data. But we do have risk adjusted on a payable position in the quarter and a receivable position with the net being the $97 million payable.
Christine Arnold \xe2\x80\x93 Cowen and Company

Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Borsch \xe2\x80\x93 Goldman Sachs
Yes. Maybe I could just pickup exactly where you were on the three R\xe2\x80\x99s, my question on the $97 million. So that\xe2\x80\x99s a new item that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x93 haven\xe2\x80\x99t guidanced, does that mean that other areas of your \xe2\x80\x93 I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s about $0.25 if I\xe2\x80\x99m calculating it right to the full-year EPS. What other areas of the business if I do that right absorbed the earnings impact of that?
Shawn M. Guertin
\n', b'
Yes. As I mentioned, the impact of that was smaller and let me explain why, you may recall that, especially in second quarter. We accrued very carefully in anticipation of having to book for this and in an attempt to make sure we covered this when we had to book. So in essence that money had been in the claim reserve if you think about it that way. When we actually did the booking, and we did all the math and applied our judgment obviously, some of that \xe2\x80\x93 some of what funded that $97 million, what had been resident in our reserves, the breakage around that is what we are sort of talking about in the quarter, which is about 50 basis points, which is plus or minus $35 million or $40 million pre-tax in the quarter.
Matthew Borsch \xe2\x80\x93 Goldman Sachs
\n', b'
Okay, got it. Okay, that makes sense. And as you talk about, the pricing actions that you are putting in, can you give us any granularity on what you see in the market in terms of competitor price actions, in terms of the regulatory situation that you may face albeit that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be an issue I gather in the 51 to 300 although maybe at the lower end to that would be, but can you just give us some detail on that?
Mark T. Bertolini
The markets remain rationale in pricing and as we go through [hick\xe2\x80\x99s] reprising and renewals. We\xe2\x80\x99re not at the top or the bottom and any of those markets. We are pretty much in the middle maintaining our competitive position. As we go into the market, where we have had concerns about what our rate increases would yield with regulators. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had conversations with them beforehand in order to ameliorate any public impact as a result of those discussions to get the rates where we were both comfortable.
And so I think overall, we see the market being pretty rationale, including in the non-regulated rate environments, particularly in the small middle market where we have taken these actions. So, we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect anybody to be pricing irrationally other than the occasional local markets where we see some impact from time-to-time.
Shawn M. Guertin
\n', b'
Yes and then I would say sort of the best evidence of that is sort of a proof in the putting concept and that is we really haven\xe2\x80\x99t been growing in fact have got stronger commercial risk membership at its core this year. And so, I think that sort of evidence of the fact that of our cautious pricing pasture, but the fact that that\xe2\x80\x99s not some precipitous drop either also shows that we\xe2\x80\x99re sort of \xe2\x80\x93 that the market is sort of on or about and around us to Mark\xe2\x80\x99s point about the rationality of the market. It\xe2\x80\x99s a trade-off that we have been willing to make in order to try to protect the Commercial MBR over time.

Our next question comes from Carl McDonald with Citigroup.
Carl McDonald \xe2\x80\x93 Citigroup
\n', b'
Great, thanks. I was hoping if you could help me with the conservatism that you\xe2\x80\x99ve suggested for the commercial loss ratio in the fourth quarter to get to the 80% for the full-year, it looks like the commercial loss ratio would have to increase less than 50 basis points sequentially. You know when I look last year, it was up 130 basis points, 350 basis points up in the fourth quarter two years ago. So it seems like there is actually less of an assumption for an increase in this fourth quarter, despite appetite to see higher individual business, some of the other things that you\xe2\x80\x99ve cited.
Mark T. Bertolini
Yes, I think there is a couple of things that you\xe2\x80\x99re not thinking about there. And first half I would say, we\xe2\x80\x99re saying approximately 80% and if you go through the guidance bridge, it certainly could be 80.1% or 80.2%. I mean I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to put that fine \xe2\x80\x93 a point of it on, but most importantly, when you think about the 81% that were just printed, as I mentioned some of what we incurred this quarter for the small to middle market business and the risk adjuster true up really has to do with Q2 as well as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that experienced a merge.
So you sort of have to back out of the 81%, maybe 50 basis points or 75 basis points of the 150 basis points of pressure. The other thing is the point I made last quarter, if you go back to my comments, the reinsurance accrual on the individual business is going to go from a $160 million and our projection is to at least 320, okay. So that went up about $100 million in Q3, so that\xe2\x80\x99s call at a 150, 160, when you do the math on that that\xe2\x80\x99s probably another 70 basis points of sort of positive MBR effect that we get out of the reinsurance timing.
I think when you do that math you\xe2\x80\x99ll come up closer to sort of 150 to 200 sort of basis point uptick for a seasonal progression.

Good morning. I was wondering if you could provide any updates at this point on how the National Accounts kind of ASC selling season progressed and then maybe related at your beneficiary of private exchange at this year, any update on how we should think about the private exchange opportunity and or headwinds maybe heading into 2015? Thanks.
Mark T. Bertolini
We expect to see some ASC, Commercial ASC attrition in the fourth quarter and that will continue into the beginning part of next year, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll see some shrinkage in the ASC market. But we will see net \xe2\x80\x93 an increase in revenue as a result of more private exchange membership and the commercial insured market.
Andy Schenker \xe2\x80\x93 Morgan Stanley
Okay, thanks. And then just lastly in the G&A, you\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of suggested there is a slightly different maybe seasonality this year with this quarter being a little bit lower with more investments maybe next year \xe2\x80\x93 next quarter maybe if you could just talk about what some of those moving pieces were and then just related to that how we should think about the seasonality maybe going forward, is this 2014 kind of the way we should think about that we\xe2\x80\x99re remodeling 2015?
Mark T. Bertolini
Yes, as you know it\xe2\x80\x99s always sort of our seasonally highest SG&A quarter and so there are number of items going on, the typical sort of marketing, an open enrollment and customer initialization type expenditures. Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re bringing up these new dual contracts in Medicaid and things like that. In addition, the type \xe2\x80\x93 the timing of some of the revenue enhancement work we\xe2\x80\x99re doing at Medicare is pushing into the fourth quarter.
We wrote 400,000 ASC members on the TRS-Active Care account on 09/01. So that expenses were shows up for a full quarter. So you\xe2\x80\x99re right. The biggest item driving sort of Q3 earnings to Q4 is really on the SG&A line, but really it\xe2\x80\x99s a host of items that are both typical and growth related that are driving that uptick.

Scott Fidel \xe2\x80\x93 Deutsche Bank
Thanks. So Shawn I\xe2\x80\x99m just interested if you could may be walk us through the mechanics of how you \xe2\x80\x93 we can be seeing a large increase in the reinsurance assumption that at the same time that we\xe2\x80\x99re also seeing an increase or an update in the risk adjustment payable? Does this just mean that the overall launches or cause are so much more significant across the overall market or does this just have to do more with that pressure that you\xe2\x80\x99re sighting in the off exchange business, which is really driving the higher reinsurance payments in the Neon exchange business it\xe2\x80\x99s different in terms of the profile the membership there, which is why you could have a risk adjustment payable relating to that.
Unidentified Company Representative
Yeah, some of that is sort of the OpEx change ACA business and remember there is also some ACA small group business that\xe2\x80\x99s subject to this now, so some of it is that. But don\xe2\x80\x99t confuse the size of the re-insurance recoverable as being worse than expected, and in fact it\xe2\x80\x99s not and in terms of sort of what we had originally estimated in pricing which lines up actually quite well with the conclusion that were going to be a net pay in on risk adjusters.
So while it\xe2\x80\x99s a big amount and it\xe2\x80\x99s stepping up, this just has more to do with how this emerge is inexperience than it does sort of a this is worse than expected, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true actually.
Scott Fidel \xe2\x80\x93 Deutsche Bank
Okay, so it\xe2\x80\x99s more \xe2\x80\x93 just you\xe2\x80\x99re giving us more granularity on the quarterly breakdown of how of those re-insurance or accruals will develop over the course of the year?
Shawn M. Guertin
I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the first time we\xe2\x80\x99re giving you a full year estimate now that we have sort of gotten into sort of a bit more stable block.
Mark T. Bertolini
But typically we reinsured this business ourselves and it\xe2\x80\x99s included in our reserves as we go through the year this we have to do separately because we have to charge the government for as it occurs. So you are seeing something that normally occurs in our small group in individual business, all of our commercials insure business for that matter, that usually stuck into the reserving models that we\xe2\x80\x99re using into the pricing that we\xe2\x80\x99re putting into the market, so you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that exposed to this process because we have to go to the government for the reimbursement.
Scott Fidel \xe2\x80\x93 Deutsche Bank
Okay, and then just one related follow up, just on the individual lives, just can you update us on what the total size of the membership is now and what the breakdown is between on and off exchange?

At the end of the quarter we had a little under 600,000 on exchange members and a little bit under 500,000 off exchange members.

Ana Gupte \xe2\x80\x93 Leerink Partners
Yeah thanks. Good morning I appreciate you\xe2\x80\x99re taking my question. So it seems to me is that you guys beat on MLR we don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about all these little pieces of it on student health and small this and all that. So, just taking a step back it does feel like trend deal spread is narrowing, and they could be in a more macro perspective, three things I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned one more (indiscernible) than the other, that there is a new regulated channel for purchase, so are seeing pressure if you will because employers have an alternative.
The other two are competitive pressures I think you said its rationale and the third one which is brought up by hospitals. Is that there is actually a cyclical rebound in trend. Out of these three things, which one dominates (indiscernible) would you agree that trend deal spread is narrowing, at least it has for this year? And what is really the driver of this and how do you see that playing out to 2015 then?

And when you look inside that, it\xe2\x80\x99s even more focused in the 51 to 100 block that I mentioned before. That\xe2\x80\x99s about a third of that block, but it\xe2\x80\x99s more than half sort of the issue that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about today. And there are certainly, I would say the biggest item is the item that I started with which is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some assumptions about cost and renewal behavior and things like that and we\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing sort of the resultant trend yield spread on that.
But I would say out of all of those things, it\xe2\x80\x99s the thing that Mark mentioned before. This is a very turbulent segment, if you will. And, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing sort of different persistency and new business patterns in this segment than we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen before, as this is a block that will eventually have to become ACA compliant.
So, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a combination of, again, the pricing assumptions versus what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen manifest itself and then some of the churn, if you will, sort of inside this block that have pressured this specifically. I\xe2\x80\x99d reiterate again that the cleanest area to look at trend yield is actually our large group business and that\xe2\x80\x99s performing consistent with expectations.

So it sounds like it\xe2\x80\x99s more about the employers having some more negotiating leverage, if you will, as you either try to keep what they have or get them to really see \xe2\x80\x93 try to really see a compliant or whatever. So for 2015, what is the pricing flexibility that you have for 2015 in that block? And do you think employers would have that kind of price so that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be priced elastic and that they would just \xe2\x80\x93 they grew the commercial group market or do they all just move more to exchanges in the 50 to 100?

I think, Ana, if the small group shop exchanges were up and the individual exchanges were functioning at a fairly high level we would see more of that. I just think a lot of employers don\xe2\x80\x99t really at that level pay a lot of attention to this stuff until they have to. And given all the changes and regulations they\xe2\x80\x99re sort of struggling to fit this into how they think about, how they move forward with benefits. And so, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had approaches to them about our early renewals. We had all sorts of conversations with them about how they ought to think about this. And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just very turbulent and difficult to pin down.
So our approach is to be much more conservative on the pricing. And so, if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that we could agree with relative to trend is that we always look toward 50 basis points to 100 basis points increase in utilization in forward pricing on our business and we continue to hold that point of view.

Okay. And then finally, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve made an interesting point about making some money on the public exchanges, but it was largely from SG&A leverage less about medical underwriting, and it seems like that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of just a broad schematic outlook for managed care right now, more top line, and finally a unit growth story, it\xe2\x80\x99s more about SG&A leverage and underwriting margins are coming in. Will that be fair and then given that what kind of an organic mode which you contemplate to?
Mark T. Bertolini
And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve yet to see how the individual market will settle out. I would argue that the public exchange markets right now were more stable than off exchange individual market, which has a lot of turnover almost a third of it every year turns over. It\xe2\x80\x99s usually people in and out of employment and moving through and so there is not a lot of stability in the off exchange market. I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see more stability in the on exchange market. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve yet to see how that\xe2\x80\x99s going to mature over time and how the competitive dynamics going to come into play, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see that soon over the next couple of months. So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t argue that it\xe2\x80\x99s just about operating leverage. We\xe2\x80\x99re pricing to a margin. We expect to get that margin, so we can get our return on capital. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the dynamics of that individual marketplace will be on exchange and until we get to another cycle or to.
Shawn M. Guertin
That\xe2\x80\x99s much more to do with taking a cautious pasture on this new program and if in fact when you think about being in risk adjuster payable position having less than your actuarial best estimate of reinsurance. There\xe2\x80\x99re many things actually that you could look at that have a positive tone to them from an underwriting performance. It\xe2\x80\x99s just right now that is not where we feel we should have that business until matures more.
Ana Gupte \xe2\x80\x93 Leerink Partners
Got it, thanks a lot.
Mark T. Bertolini
I would also ask that everyone please limit themselves to one question, so that we can get to the remaining people in the queue. Thank you.

Next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.
David Styblo \xe2\x80\x93 Jefferies & Co.
Good morning. It\xe2\x80\x99s Dave Styblo for Windley. I going to ask a question similar to Carl\xe2\x80\x99s earlier, but as we think about the bridge to the fourth quarter government [NOR] (ph), it looks like you\xe2\x80\x99re making in about a 150 basis point increase. I am curious \xe2\x80\x93 I think it was flat last year, so I am curious what the assumptions are that that would cause us to ramp so much, is it I sense perhaps but it\xe2\x80\x99s the duals coming online, but can you give us a better sense of that bridge please.
Mark T. Bertolini
It\xe2\x80\x99s largely \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s the duals. And so, we have a lot of passive enrollment coming online later in the year. The group \xe2\x80\x93 the business starting to grow, in the beginning it was not passive enrollment, but now we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that as we go through the year and that\xe2\x80\x99s ramping up. So we\xe2\x80\x99re being conservative in our estimates of what we believe cost to be in that segment.

Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.
A.J. Rice \xe2\x80\x93 UBS
Hi, everyone. Mark, you\xe2\x80\x99ve commented openly about potential for consolidation within the industry. At this point in the call maybe I will ask that broad question do you see prospects for a consolidation activity stepping up as we look into 2015. You\xe2\x80\x99re in a position now with where you\xe2\x80\x99ve got Coventry to be an active participant. And how \xe2\x80\x93 as you thought \xe2\x80\x93 thinking about what would be of interest evolves at all.
Thomas Cowhey
One time on Coventry, so we are at the higher end of our range $0.55 to $0.60 on our accretion, we expect that $0.90 will be achievable in 2015. And we have not been able to qualify things like the impact of Medicare stars ratings and the impact of the Medicare team from Coventry on our results to-date, but we still see $0.90 is very achievable.
The Coventry integration is done, the Coventry migration is not. So we still have work to do in transitioning systems. However, our balance sheet is in better shape, our cash flow strong and we continue to look at acquisitions in the technology space around provider and around consumer and are always interested in discussing consolidation opportunity should exist where we believe we have an opportunity to get a fair return to our shareholders.
A.J. Rice \xe2\x80\x93 UBS
Okay, thanks.
Thomas Cowhey
Thanks A.J. That\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the last question we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to take today.
