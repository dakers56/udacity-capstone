Good morning. My name is Melissa and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Aetna Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.
All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cowhey, you may begin.
Thomas F. Cowhey - Vice President-Investor Relations
Good morning, and thank you for joining Aetna\'s third quarter 2015 earnings call and webcast. This is Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna. And with me this morning are Aetna\'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Bertolini, and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks, we will answer your questions. Karen Lynch, Aetna\'s President will also join us for the Q&A session.
During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning\'s press release and the reports we file with the SEC. We have also provided reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures in our financial supplement and guidance summary. These reconciliations are available on the Investor Information section of aetna.com.
In light of the ongoing regulatory review of Aetna\'s pending acquisition of Humana, we will not hold an investor conference this year. As a result, we intend to provide detailed 2016 guidance on our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call in early February.
Finally, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in non-public forums is limited, so we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported third quarter operating earnings of $1.90 per share delivering another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter results are a continuation of our momentum from the first half of the year, specifically, underwriting margin performance was strong as our total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio improved by 120 basis points year-over-year. Our Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio improved by 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by our group Commercial businesses. And the Government Medical Benefit Ratio improved by 240 basis points year-over-year driven by continued strong results in our Medicare business.
Pre-tax operating margins reached 8.4% in the quarter consistent with our high-single digit pre-tax operating margin targets and we generated nearly $1.3 billion in Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow.
Based on our strong third quarter results, we are raising our full-year 2015 operating EPS guidance to a range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share. This represents the fourth time we have increased our 2015 operating EPS projection. At the midpoint of our updated range, Aetna would now achieve 12% year-over-year operating EPS growth, a result that would be at the high end of our low-double digit operating EPS growth target.
In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our third quarter results and improved outlook, but first, I am going to provide a brief update on the Humana acquisition and discuss some of the operational highlights of the quarter.
Aetna\'s mission is to build a healthier world. In Humana, we believe we have found the ideal partner to complement and accelerate our efforts. Though the projected closing of the acquisition is still months away, our integration teams are working in earnest to ensure we achieve, if not exceed, our synergy and accretion goals. We are excited to welcome Rick Jelinek to our executive team as the leader of our integration efforts. We are confident his wealth of industry knowledge and experience will help deliver a smooth integration as we choose the best processes and talent from both organizations to create a stronger enterprise.
All material state regulatory filings have been made for the proposed transaction. And we have received our first state approval for the transaction. We continue to work diligently with the Department of Justice in a collaborative and constructive manner. Last week, the shareholders of both Humana and Aetna overwhelming voted to approve the transaction, another significant milestone as we progress on our journey to deal completion.
We remain confident that we are on track to achieve a successful close in the second half of 2016, and that Humana is the right cultural and strategic partner to create customer and shareholder value through the new Aetna.
Moving on to third quarter highlights. Our Government businesses continue to perform well. Specifically, the momentum in our Medicare businesses in the first half of the year continued into the third quarter. We increased Medicare medical membership by 40,000 members in the quarter, with growth across Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage. From a year-to-date perspective, we have grown our Medicare membership by 11%, including over 14% individual Medicare Advantage growth.
Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow our Medicare Advantage business in 2016 as program funding will increase for the first time in several years. We continue to expand our geographic footprint and will now offer products in 745 counties for 2016. Representing nearly half of the Medicare-eligible population and based on the recently published 2016 Medicare Advantage star ratings, 87% of our membership is in four-star or greater plans, the highest percentage as compared to our national peers.
Our Medicaid business also performed very well. We grew by 86,000 members in the quarter, primarily from additions in state programs related to ACA expansion. Despite continued slow growth in the duals programs and mid-year rate decreases in our Kentucky contract, we still delivered solid pre-tax operating margins in Medicaid. We remain focused on the opportunity to continue to grow this business and we look forward to serving new populations, including members in the recently awarded Michigan Medicaid contract and the Texas STAR Kids Program.
Shifting to our public exchange and consumer efforts, the individual business remains challenging, especially in light of the continued administrative changes for this new and developing membership pool. Despite these challenges, we continue to work constructively with CMS and the states to serve our 1.1 million individual members.
We\'ve always said that Aetna would participate in this emerging opportunity in a prudent manner in geographies where we have the cost structure to offer attractive products to consumers and earn an appropriate return for our shareholders. In keeping with our strategy, Aetna will participate on individual exchanges in 15 states in 2016, as compared to 17 states in 2015. A footprint that we continue to believe can drive net membership growth.
Further, as part of our 2016 offerings, Aetna will launch new consumer-focused health solutions for individuals and families in four existing geographies. These innovative products will feature simplified benefit structures and an improved consumer experience. Central to these new products will be access to helpful digital tools with clear information about healthcare resources, coverage and costs. We intend to use our experience with these new products as preparation for a broader roll-out in the future as we continue our journey to help reshape the healthcare system.
Additionally, we are excited that Gary Loveman has joined the Aetna team to help lead the newly-expanded Healthagen, including our consumer businesses. Under his leadership, we are confident that we will make our consumer-centric healthcare vision a reality.
In summary, as we finish out the year and look toward 2016 and beyond, we are well positioned to crossing number of major growth opportunities, including Medicare, Medicaid and the public exchanges. We continue to work diligently on planning for the Humana integration and we are excited about the value that our combination will create for consumers and shareholders.
I am pleased with our results and I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering yet another strong quarter for Aetna. I am confident we have the right vision to be a leader in the changing healthcare marketplace, we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy, we will close and successfully integrate the proposed Humana acquisition, we can achieve our 2015 operating earnings per share projection of $7.45 to $7.55, and we can grow both operating earnings and operating EPS in 2016.
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our third quarter results, our updated 2015 outlook, and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2016. Shawn?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.
Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2015 operating earnings of $669 million, and operating earnings per share of $1.90. Aetna\'s operating results continue to be supported by strong cash flow and operating margins. I\'ll begin with some comments on overall performance.
Our top-line performance was steady for the quarter. Medical membership declined to approximately 23.5 million members, as growth in Government membership was more than offset by declines in our group Commercial and individual businesses. Operating revenue was $15 billion, driven primarily by higher premium yields and membership growth in our Government business.
From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pre-tax operating margin was 8.4% for the quarter, a 60-basis point year-over-year improvement. Our third quarter total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio was 81.1%, a strong result that benefited from disciplined pricing, continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable reserve development.
Our operating expense ratio was 18.6%, a 40-basis point increase over the third quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of continued investment spending on our growth initiatives and lower than projected operating revenue growth.
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to second quarter 2015 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth. And days and claims payable were 54.3 days at the end of quarter, up 2.5 days sequentially, and 4.6 days on a year-over-year basis.
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. On a year-to-date basis, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.4 times operating earnings. We continue to project that our full-year 2015 Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows will exceed our 2015 operating earnings. Our ability to repurchase shares was constrained by the proposed Humana acquisition, and we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. We did, however, distribute $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend.
In summary, we are quite pleased with our third quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. I will now discuss the key drivers of our third quarter performance in greater detail.
Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial membership declined by approximately 300,000 members during the quarter, largely driven by our group Commercial and individual businesses. This performance is consistent with recent membership trends in these blocks, our previously discussed pricing actions to improve performance in our group Commercial business and enrollment patterns in our individual business.
Our Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio was 80.7% for the quarter, a 30-basis point improvement over the same period last year. Our third quarter Commercial MBR was influenced by continued moderate medical cost trends and strong performance in our group Commercial business, partially offset by an updated view on 3R accruals in our ACA compliant businesses. Based on our year-to-date experience, we project that Aetna\'s 2015 Core Commercial medical cost trend will be approximately 6%.
We continue to drive growth in our Government business, where we grew by 126,000 members in the quarter. Medicare Advantage grew by 13,000 members. Medicare Supplement grew by 27,000 members. And Medicaid membership also grew by 86,000 members.
Our third quarter 2015 Government premiums grew to $5.7 billion, a 6.6% increase over the prior-year quarter. Our Government Medical Benefit Ratio was 81.6% in the quarter, a 240-basis point improvement over the same period last year, driven primarily by continued momentum in our Medicare business.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure, and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At September 30, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 33%.
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $385 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. After other uses, including payment of transaction-related expenses, we ended the quarter with approximately $180 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was 348.7 million at September 30.
As a result of our third quarter performance, we are increasing our 2015 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share. This represents the seventh quarter in a row we have raised our operating EPS guidance and the fourth time we have increased our projection this year.
Our updated 2015 guidance is influenced by the following drivers. Based on our third quarter membership results, we now project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23.3 million members. Primarily based on lower membership and mix, we have revised our outlook on full-year 2015 operating revenue, which we now project to be approximately $60 billion. This top-line projection is a result of our continued stance to favor margin over membership particularly in our group Commercial blocks of business.
We now project our full-year total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio will be 81% plus or minus 30 basis points. We continue to project that our full-year 2015 Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio will be essentially flat when compared to our 2014 Commercial MBR. This projection is generally consistent with current consensus estimates for this metric. Our current view is that our operating expense ratio will be approximately 19% for the full year, a result of lower than projected revenues and continued investment spending as we execute on our strategy.
We now project our pre-tax operating margin to be at least 8%, consistent with our high-single digit target with operating earnings between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. Finally, we now expect that net subsidiary dividends for the year will be up to $2.4 billion and Aetna\'s parent cash balance will be approximately $400 million at year-end. We continue to project that our 2015 weighted average diluted share count will be approximately 353 million shares, reflecting our limited ability to repurchase shares as a result of the proposed Humana acquisition.
Moving on to 2016. We do not typically provide forward guidance on our third quarter call, however, as we will not be providing detailed 2016 guidance until early next year, I wanted to provide some directional commentary on Aetna\'s 2016 earnings outlook on a stand-alone basis. As you know, we do not, as a matter of course, include prior year\'s reserve development in our guidance. When we exclude prior year\'s reserve development and other items from our projected 2015 performance, we currently believe Aetna\'s 2015 baseline earnings power is approximately $7 per share. Our goal is to achieve at least low-double digit growth off this operating EPS baseline next year.
While uncertainties remain and we continue to work through our forecasting process, we are incorporating a number of challenges in our outlook, including the projected impact of known membership attrition in our Commercial ASC business and certain large insured customers that are projected to convert to alternative funding arrangements, the projected full-year impact of the rate reset in our Kentucky Medicaid contract, and the fact that our operating EPS outlook typically incorporates a benefit from share repurchases, which we are no longer projecting because of the pending Humana transaction.
We are also incorporating a number of opportunities in our outlook, including continued membership growth in our Medicare and Medicaid products. The opportunity to improve margins on our ACA-compliant and dual-eligible membership and fixed cost leverage as we continue to grow revenue and actively manage costs.
In summary, our goal is to grow our 2015 operating EPS baseline of $7 per share at low-double digit rates next year. This growth floor, which does not presume any prior year\'s reserve development, would be driven entirely by underlying operating earnings performance as share repurchases do not contribute to operating EPS growth in our 2016 outlook. Further, if medical cost trends were to develop below our projections similar to the last several years, we could see upside to our outlook.
As we enter the final quarter of 2015 and begin to look toward 2016, the fundamentals of Aetna\'s business remain strong and we are confident in our projected operating EPS range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share, and our ability to grow operating EPS at low-double digit rates over time.
The Humana acquisition will only serve to enhance our position as a leader in the transformation of the healthcare system, delivering more cost-effective products to customers and enhancing our ability to achieve and exceed our long-term growth objectives. We remain committed and confident that we can close the Humana transaction in the second half of 2016, and that we can achieve at least $11 of operating EPS in 2018 as a combined company.
I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?
Thomas F. Cowhey - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions. Operator, the first question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi, thanks. I appreciate the question. I guess I want to follow-up a little bit about 2016 and maybe even beyond that, and understanding that you guys are setting a floor at sort of low-double digit growth. You mentioned some headwinds and some opportunities as well. And I guess I\'m just trying to figure out the exchange business, you talked about the ACA compliant plans, that being a margin \xe2\x80\x93 a good guy potential. And then I also want to understand, I guess, in the context of, do you really feel like you need to be there on those ACA-compliant plans? And then on the Government side, margins have been running a lot better than we had expected, I think others in the industry are seeing some similar trends. I can\'t imagine that was all caught in the 2016 bids in June, so should we expect those margins to be sustained in 2016, and maybe longer-term thoughts on Government margin?
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Let me start off, Josh, with a couple of points. I think in the ACA-compliant plans and in the public exchanges, we view this as a long-term market potential. It\'s still early. We like the dynamics of the markets we\'re in. And I\'ll remind everybody that it was our view that we would go into markets where we had a cost structure that could develop an affordable product for people in those communities. And so our changes in this current year are related to our ability to do so. But we think it\'s way too early to call it quits on the ACA and on the exchanges, we view it still as a big opportunity for the company. I\'ll remind everybody it\'s just a little over 6% of our operating revenue, so we still view it as an opportunity to play.
In relationship to the Government margins, we believe that we will not have the same level of Government margins. But we will have some pressure on them going backwards in 2016. But our 2015 margins are healthy. We believe that is related to two things: our strong growth, our investment in scorable action items \xe2\x80\x93 and I would also add, our star ratings are having a material impact on growth in our plans, and also on our opportunity to generate a higher margin.
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Yeah. So Josh, I\'d just append a few comments, thinking about the margin. In the Government business, I think, to your point about how well it\'s been performed, we\'ve gotten into our target mid-single digit margin range on Medicare this year, and I do think, given the strength of the performance and the factors Mark mentioned, we can continue to perform in that mid-single digit range next year. I think where we\'ll get a little bit of pressure on the margin is on Medicaid, and a lot of that is obviously just emanating from Kentucky, given how large a contract that is in our portfolio. Having said that, I still think the overall performance of the Government business will be very strong again in 2016.
The exchange business, in terms of margin improvement, I think this is a year where we knew a lot more about pricing at the beginning of this year than we knew a year ago. And while I don\'t think we\'d ever think that we would achieve sort of a target pricing profitability, I think we have a lot more confidence that we can improve the profitability position on that business in 2016 versus 2015; again, as Mark mentioned, we\'ve always known since day one this was a multi-year and sort of longer-term proposition in this market.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And Shawn, just a quick follow-up on that last one. Safe to assume you\'re not making money on the exchanges, including 3R accruals, et cetera, in 2015?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Yes. Yes, that is safe to assume.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Just a broad question on 2016, I\'m not sure I exactly heard your comments, Shawn, right, but it sounded like you were saying that your sort of preliminary growth target was reflective of a medical cost trend that, if you ended up back at where we were this year, that \xe2\x80\x93 that would be favorable to it. Can you give us a little more flavor, are you assuming, therefore, an increase in medical cost trend next year implicit in your comments, versus what we saw this year, and any flavor for what you\'re anticipating across buckets, if I could?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Yeah, so very similar to the assumptions and operating principles we\'ve had the last few years. We are assuming a modest uptick in utilization trend in our forward pricing for 2016. And, again, to the extent, obviously, that that doesn\'t manifest itself, as it largely hasn\'t this year. That is a potential good guy. Obviously, I don\'t want to go there yet. That\'s the purpose of assuming the uptick. But we have continued to maintain, I think, a prudent position on our forward pricing particularly in the group Commercial business.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And maybe, also clarify comments you made about the full-year update on the guidance in the fourth quarter. Is there anything that happened in the third quarter that you were previously anticipating in the fourth quarter, was there any pull forward, seems like some of the other companies maybe had a little pull forward into third from fourth (25:39), is there anything like that?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
No, not anything that I think is meaningful. There\'s always very small, but, no, nothing that I would say sort of had any kind of meaningful impact on the Q3 results. The one thing I would comment on, though, in Q3 actually is the 3Rs. As I alluded to in my remarks, we\'ve continued to take up our accruals on risk adjustment and adjust our accruals on the other elements including reinsurance. And that probably, in Q3, was worth about $65 million pre-tax worse than our previous sort of expectation. So that\'s about 90 bps on the Commercial MBR for the quarter and I think that actually speaks to how well \xe2\x80\x93 going back to your question, actually, how well our group Commercial business is actually performing and I\'d like to think that part of that is, again, that we\'ve taken a cautious position on sort of forward pricing on that business.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC
Great, thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. Thanks. I guess kind of maybe staying on the Commercial, I guess, re-pricing that you were doing this year that impacted membership to some degree, is that done or should we think about that as continuing to be a headwind into next year?
Karen S. Lynch - President
Hi, Kevin, it\'s Karen. We will continue to favor pricing and margin over membership. We\'re continuing to look at our 50 to 100 (27:28) book where we, as you know, priced it at the end of 2014 and continue to price it through 2015, the results are reflected in third quarter and we feel good about it. We will continue to manage pricing in the small group business, so you can expect to see some volume attrition in 2016 as a reflection of our pricing actions.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, thanks. And I guess, I don\'t know if you guys have any view into the Humana at all. I mean, obviously they reaffirmed guidance, is there anything that you took away from what they have said publicly or if you have any view about how the performance is going versus what you expected coming into Q3?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
We really don\'t have any comment. We don\'t have a whole lot of insight other than what we hear from them.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
The $65 million bad guy in the quarter, did you add that back when you started with your $7 run rate for this year? Or did you adjust for the 3Rs generally for the year into that run rate number?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
On the $65 million that you\'re talking about, specifically, no, because that\'s really more of a current-year item. Now, if you went back a couple of quarters, we did have some true-ups related to 2014, but we\'re probably talking about a dime, plus or minus. And so very simply, if you wanted to think about it with where our guidance is with a midpoint of $7.50. If you netted out PYD and any of that prior year related to 3Rs, you\'re probably in the neighborhood of $0.60, $0.50, in that zone, when you net those out. And that\'s sort of how we got to the $7. But, specifically, the $65 million that I mentioned is really an update to our estimates related to the 2015 performance, so we haven\'t taken those out.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. And then, I don\'t know if Gary Loveman\'s on the call here at all, but I\'m wondering, if he is, or if you want to talk about how the plans are to use data in Healthagen to sort of increase your marketing and perhaps change sort of the dynamics of what you\'ve got going on in the ACA compliant plans now?
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, Peter, I would say a couple of things. First, one of the things we did in bringing Gary on board was we combined both our new Commercial launches, the four markets that we alluded to during the conference call during the prepared remarks, into our Healthagen businesses to begin to create what we would call the new Aetna. So a set of provider relationships in local market, products and services that are driven at the local market level around a retail marketplace. So individual across any kind of payor. Actually, agnostic of any payor.
And so Gary\'s role is to help us think about how we do that. How we get to a very different customer experience. As you know, Gary has a background in applied mathematics. Professor in Applied Mathematics at Harvard. And so his whole role of understanding the consumer. He\'s written a book on understanding the consumer in a lot of industries, and demonstrated a bit of it in the gaming industry. But our view is that Gary\'s insights and ways of thinking about the future are an exciting opportunity for us to create a very different kind of result in the marketplace.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC
Hi. Thank you. In the Government business, and particularly looking at MLR, you had expected in your guidance after 2Q for the Government MLR to rise in the back half. It feels like third quarter outperformed and now you\'re expecting fourth quarter to rise. I guess what I\'m interested in is, is the back half progressing as you expected, or did it actually outperform in the third quarter? And what would be the factors that you would expect to cause Government MLR to rise in the fourth quarter? Thanks.
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Yeah. So you\'re right, Dave, in the sense that probably the biggest area of favorable outperformance in Q3 continued to be the Government business. We have assumed that that biz \xe2\x80\x93 you\'re right, in that our guidance assumes that the MBR will go up in the fourth quarter for that business. We\'re, in essence, taking a little bit of the favorability that we\'ve seen, but we\'re certainly not forecasting all of it as we\'ve seen. We\'ve tended to see sort of a bit of a seasonal increase on the Medicare MBR, as sort of the year wears on in the past. So you\'re correct. We have not forecast all of it, but we have forecast a little bit of it to finally show up in Q4.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC
Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC
Hey, there. Could you speak to what you\'re expecting on the national account ASL book? You alluded to some changes in terms of the purchasing patterns of that population. And then you also alluded to some issues kind of driven by the administration of the public exchange business. Could you speak to what you think is happening there this year and why you\'re convinced that it will improve next year? Thanks.
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I\'ll take the last part of that question, Christine, then I\'ll ask Karen to comment on the national accounts marketplace. I think what we\'ve seen with the changes in the 3Rs, the risk corridors, a lot of the keep what you have. The game has sort of moved pretty steadily over the last two, three years. And our review is, is that when you start having impacts on significant inputs to pricing, there are mistakes made. And we\'re seeing that with the co-op failures that continue to happen and the shifting dynamic in the marketplace. And we look forward to getting the market more stable. And I think that\'s going to be something that is going to happen past this administration.
If you think about Medicare and everything that\'s done for Medicare every year, we are constantly tweaking the program and making it better. And I think the result has been a very favorable product for seniors particularly with one-third of them now on Medicare Advantage and a large population in the PDP program. We would like to see that kind of analysis and continued shaping of the program in the Affordable Care Act and the public exchanges but unfortunately the politics of it don\'t allow it to happen now. We think that that will change in the future and that will get a much more stable marketplace. Karen?
Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC
Do you think there is an adverse risk pool developing there? It seems like everyone is pretty disappointed third quarter relative to second. Is that just \xe2\x80\x93 we\'ve got more experience people have their card for nine months, or is the risk pool deteriorating?
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I would say the risk pool is not nearly as balanced as everybody thought it would be as we got near the end of the 3Rs and that it continues to look like it did in the first year with the demographics and age categories pretty much the same. They got a little bit better in the second year. There is not a lot of hope or change expected for 2016. So our view is, is that this is a more adversely impacted population than we otherwise would have expected had we not made all the changes we made to the program.
Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks.
Karen S. Lynch - President
Good morning, Christine. Relative to national accounts, first, I would just note for the 2016 selling cycle, we had one of our better-performing new sales year. However, some of that momentum is being masked by some of the impact of losing or accounts going to slice. So we had some large jumbo accounts that decided to offer more choice went into slice, and we had some terminations, so we expect to see notable decline in ASC membership as a result of those big jumbo cases, when we come into the first quarter of 2016. I would also note, relative to membership, one of our large ASC members up for assurance, as you know, has made the decision to exit the healthcare business, and so that will impact our membership in 2016 as well.
Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC
How is the short (36:32) affecting your membership next year?
Karen S. Lynch - President
There was a customer in our network access business, so it was counted as membership, so that will affect our membership counts.
Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC
Are you quantifying that, or do I have to wait till next quarter?
Karen S. Lynch - President
Have to wait till next quarter.
Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay, thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Yes, I just had a question on your individual Medicare Advantage book. I think you talked about your Government business overall being at your target margin level of mid-single digits. Albeit we don\'t have the details, but it would seem to me that maybe, for individual MA, your margin would be more in the high-single digits. I mean, given where your Government MCR is overall and thinking about Medicaid and thinking about an all-in operating cost ratio of maybe 10% in that business. Am I off there? And if I\'m not off, what do you think is sustainable?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
No, we\'re not quite in that range yet, for a margin on that business. We still are in the mid-single digits. And I actually have thought, and continue to think, that mid-single digits is a sustainable margin for the individual product. You\'re right in the sense that one of the bigger improvements in 2015 versus 2014 is certainly the margin performance of the individual business, but we\'re still in that range. Part of the reason that we\'ve done that is the investments that we continue to make in STARs, as an example, which obviously bring with it some SG&A expense.
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I would say, Matt, we in the past have talked about us taking a few years to get to our target margins in individual. We got there earlier than we anticipated.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.
And on the same broad topic, as you look now at the open enrollment process underway, it\'s just started, but you have seen how your products stack up against competitors. Do you think that you can achieve a stronger result next year as the 14% growth in individual MA that you did for this year, which obviously included not only growth in the program, but market share gains as well?
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
As you said, it\'s really early, Matt, but I would say that we like what we see in the markets, and our relative position in the markets where we\'ve entered. But we\'re still in the midst of finalizing our operating plan, so we\'re not locked down on what we think that growth will be yet.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.
One last one, if I could sneak it in. Should we think about the PPD, as we bridge from 2015 to 2016, being in the range of maybe $0.30 to $0.35, or is that too much of a net number?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Well, again, we don\'t forecast that. So let me be clear that, if you looked at historical levels, that\'s probably in the ZIP code, maybe a little bit at the high end.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks. I appreciate your color broadly on continuing to favor margins over membership. But thinking big picture, how would you define the competitiveness in the pricing environment? Will the failure of the co-ops give you an opportunity to gain share you might not have otherwise been expecting, including maybe in small group in some markets, how is pricing broadly? Thank you.
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We still see pricing as largely rational. There are markets from time to time where we see a little bit of irrational pricing, but I\'d like to caution everybody \xe2\x80\x93 from the point of view is that, I don\'t \xe2\x80\x93 I mean, it\'s always easy for us to point at a competitor and say, they\'re being irrational in their pricing. Maybe they have a better cost structure, and we don\'t have the best cost structure in every market.
So, I always raise an eyebrow when the team says, well, we\'ve got irrational pricing in X market. I always say, well, have you looked at their cost structure and do you know how they have structured it? So I would say largely rational; we haven\'t seen any significant changes. I think what we saw with the co-ops was the immaturity of that model and the anticipation that they could, quote-unquote, somehow hold the big health plans honest by pricing at a level that captured a lot of membership, and we knew that that was going to be troublesome and unsustainable.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then, switching gears here to your performance in the group business this quarter, as well as maybe a little bit on the large case. Pension was definitely below what we were expecting on a segment that gets that much attention. How should we think about performance in those businesses in 4Q and into next year; any trends there worth highlighting? Thanks.
Karen S. Lynch - President
Relative to the group business, it is performing where we expected. If you look at last year at this time, we had some outperformance in that business. We had a little pressure in the quarter on our life claims but, as you know, that\'s a very volatile business and life goes up and down on the quarters. Relative to next year, you can expect similar margin performance on that business as we think about 2016.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Good morning. Just to get on the individual side, clearly, there\'s some macro dynamics going on, you guys and your peers are all talking about similar dynamics but I guess was there anything you felt you did wrong this year that\'s hurting you, and conversely, what do you feel you\'ve done right? And then, Mark, big picture, you seem pretty confident that things will get better over time but if the enrollment sort of stays flattish, do you think that things will actually get better or could this actually begin to go in the wrong direction? Thanks.
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think what we\'re seeing in a lot of the sectors of the healthcare industry particularly the hospital business is the fact that the membership is getting flattish and that\'s having an impact across the sectors. And so I would say that flattish membership in the exchanges is largely a function of our inability to update the products and services in a way that learn from all of the learnings that we have every year as Shawn mentioned earlier, we now have more information.
We have some really interesting deep insights on the businesses, it looks across metal categories and CSRs and everything else and we were anxious to \xe2\x80\x93 we\'re going to start sharing some of that with CMS as we begin to tell them how we could better manage the program, gain more enrollment but we were just pulling that data together now that we have a few quarters under our belt and we\'re able to see some real trends in how the market is used.
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Yeah, Chris, I think the thing when you think about performance this year, you have to go all the way back to the first and second quarter of last year when we actually had to establish the pricing. And at that point, we didn\'t have a single shred of data on risk adjustment. We still had people in a special enrollment period sort of with membership coming in. And so I\'m not sure I would say that we did anything wrong, but we really didn\'t have the information, to Mark\'s point, that we have today to set forward pricing.
I would say, clearly, what we did right was, again, going back to what Mark talked about, was we had a lot of focus on making sure we had a cost structure and program in place to sustain a lot of the price positions that we had. And we actually limited where we played to those places, where we thought we had a winning game plan for cost structure. And I think we largely see that playing out today in a somewhat favorable way, in a number of markets, whether that\'s both from a volume or a margin perspective.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC
Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Just coming back to your comments on the guidance. Just wanted to understand that double-digits assumption year-over-year. Are you assuming a flat Commercial margin going into 2016, and how does the definition of small group to only under 50 (45:24), does that help you at all in terms of retention and price hardening?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Yeah, I\'ll let Karen talk about the small group definition. We\'re not providing detailed guidance at this juncture, but the one thing obviously that I did comment on was that we thought that we could improve the margin profile of the ACA compliant blocks, really being both individual and the small group ACA business. And so that would certainly create favorable margin dynamics within the Commercial risk business as we sit here today.
Karen S. Lynch - President
And, Ana, relative to the change from the pay sacked, we are quite pleased with that change. It allows us to continue to medically underwrite the business. As you know, we anticipated that to go to ACA 11-16. We were able to quickly pivot and start underwriting that book for next year. So it\'s a net positive for us.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC
And then, also, on the Medicaid book for next year, are you assuming any pressure at all? One of your competitors yesterday was indicating that the rates and even outside of Kentucky, there could be some pressure. There\'s been concern generally around their comments?
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I wouldn\'t say \xe2\x80\x93 listen, there\'s always pressure on any kind of sort of Medicaid renewal rate, just given sort of state fiscal pressure. So we always sort of anticipate some of that, and we try to put plans in place in advance of that to be able to sort of accommodate that. Obviously, the most notable pressure is the one I commented on before, which is sort of the annualization, if you will, of what happened in Kentucky this year, in the middle of the year.
The one area that we\'re working to improve, though, obviously, is we\'re still in the early stages of our high acuity membership. The duals and the long-term support services. And that\'s something, obviously, that we\'d be working on, improving the profitability over time, as expected.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC

Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Brian Wright with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT
Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to get a real quick data question before the real question. Did you give us the actual sequential change in the ACA compliant individual plans?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Are you talking about the 3Rs?
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT
No, no. Just what happened with your ACA compliant individual membership sequentially.
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Okay. Yeah, the individual membership is down about 100,000 members from the second quarter to the third quarter. Small group, in total, is down about 100,000 members as well, quarter-to-quarter. I can get you the \xe2\x80\x93 we can follow up with the specific ACA -
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT
Yeah, that\'s great. Thank you so much. And then, kind of the real question. I just wanted to clarify kind of the commentary on 2016. So this year, through nine months, you\'ve got $769 million of favorable prior-year reserve development. What you\'re saying is, you\'re excluding the abnormal part of that in \xe2\x80\x93 there were two comments. One that seemed to indicate that may be $0.60 a share, and then another that said it was more like $0.30 to $0.40. So I just wanted to clarify that a little bit, please.
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Yeah. So let me be very clear on this. So through the first half of the year, if you looked at the prior-year development, in some of that, we haven\'t got a net benefit from because we\'ve had to put it up in minimum MLR accruals. At the end of the second quarter, that was worth about $0.50. That same math at the end of the third quarter now is worth about $0.60. So we\'re basically taking that out entirely. Just, again, this is how we provide our initial guidance. So if you took the $0.60 out of our guidance, you\'d end up with sort of a base number, a baseline number of around $7 per share. And growing that at least at a low-double digit rate, that\'s the number that we\'re applying that to.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT
Great. Thank you so much.
