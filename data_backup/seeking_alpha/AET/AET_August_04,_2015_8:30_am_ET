Good morning. My name is Jessie and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Aetna\'s Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now turn the conference over to Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cowhey, you may begin.
Thomas F. Cowhey - Vice President-Investor Relations
Good morning, and thank you for joining Aetna\'s second quarter 2015 earnings call and webcast. This is Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna, and with me this morning are Aetna\'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Bertolini; and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks, we will answer your questions. Karen Rohan, Aetna\'s President, will also join us for the Q&A session.
Before we begin, I would like to address some regulatory requirements. Today\'s presentation is neither an offering of securities, nor a solicitation of a proxy vote. The information discussed today is qualified in its entirety by the registration statement and joint proxy statement that Aetna and Humana will be filing in the future, and Aetna\'s and Humana\'s shareholders are urged to read those filings carefully.
In addition, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning\'s press release and the reports we file with the SEC. We have also provided reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures in our financial supplement and guidance summary. These reconciliations are available on the Investor Information section of aetna.com.
Further, in recognition of the many moving pieces related to the premium stabilization programs commonly referred to as the 3Rs, we have published a short presentation detailing our accruals for these programs, the impact on our second quarter Commercial MBR, as well as our updated full-year 2015 MBR guidance on the Investor Information section of aetna.com.
Finally, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in non-public forums is limited. So, we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.
With that, I\'ll turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported strong second quarter operating earnings of $2.05 per share, a 21% increase from last year\'s second quarter.
Underlying our second quarter results are sound operating fundamentals, as evidenced by: record quarterly operating revenue of over $15.1 billion; medical cost trends that remained moderate and drove a healthy level of reserve development in the quarter; a total medical benefit ratio that improved 200 basis points year-over-year; and pre-tax operating margins of 8.7%, an improvement of 110 basis points over last year\'s second quarter.
Based on our strong second quarter results, we are raising our full-year 2015 operating EPS guidance to at least $7.40 per share, eliminating the bottom end of our previous range, and recognizing the potential for meaningful upside in our full-year outlook, particularly as we contemplate our continuing prudent stance on accruing for the 3Rs.
This quarter is the sixth quarter in a row that we have increased our operating EPS projection. Even at the minimum performance level we are projecting, our updated guidance represents over 10% year-over-year operating EPS growth, consistent with our low double-digit long-term operating EPS growth target.
In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter results and improved outlook. But, first, I am going to re-emphasize the rationale behind our proposed acquisition of Humana and briefly discuss some of the operational highlights of the quarter.
In early July, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Humana. The combination will create one of the country\'s largest managed care companies, with strong membership positions across multiple lines of business. We believe this strategic acquisition is very compelling, will provide significant value to customers and deliver attractive returns for shareholders. Specifically, the acquisition will substantially accelerate our ability to grow in Medicare Advantage. Aetna\'s current Medicare Advantage footprint covers approximately 45% of the Medicare eligible population.
The combined companies serve 4.4 million Medicare Advantage members, representing 8% of today\'s 54 million Medicare beneficiaries, and will expand our geographic footprint to cover approximately 90% of the Medicare eligible population. This expanded reach will increase our ability to continue to offer high quality products to customers and capitalize on the projected growth in Medicare programs.
We believe there\'s an opportunity to improve the performance of Humana\'s Commercial and Medicaid businesses by deploying our strong capabilities in both these areas. The combination will reduce costs, which will enable the combined company to provide more cost-effective products to consumers.
Humana\'s significant investment in consumer engagement, as evidenced by their industry-leading net promoter score and Medicare Advantage star ratings, will enhance our own consumer engagement efforts. The combination brings together two companies with a shared vision of enabling providers to transition from episodic care to a population health model.
And, finally, the Humana acquisition adds a growing services business and reintroduces certain PBM capabilities to our portfolio, providing longer term optionality to create a high growth, high margin, non-regulated cash flow stream. All of these strategic benefits are accomplished in a transaction that is financially compelling and projected to be accretive not only to earnings per share, but to our operating EPS growth rate.
Moving on to second quarter highlights. Beginning with our Group Commercial business, operating results for our large group Commercial business was strong in the second quarter. We continue to favor margin over membership in this business, producing strong operating margins and predictable capital generation that enables the investments needed to drive our long-term growth strategy.
While the quarterly operating performance of our small group and individual businesses was impacted by the official CMS calculations on risk adjusters, we continue to be pleased with the underlying performance across these blocks of business and how they are positioned for 2016.
Moving on, our Government business had another standout quarter. Starting with Medicare, we increased Medicare medical membership by 24,000 members during the quarter, driven by Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage. We continue to believe that Medicare is one of the most attractive growth opportunities for our company and our industry. Year-to-date, Aetna\'s Medicare Advantage revenues have increased by 12% over the same period last year, and we are on track to achieve mid single-digit pre-tax operating margins in this business this year.
Our Medicaid business also delivered another strong quarter of results. We grew medical membership by 42,000 members across multiple state programs and delivered pre-tax operating margins near the high end of our targeted range for this business. While the ramp in the duals demonstration programs continues to lag our expectations, we believe in the long-term opportunity of the duals program, as well as the opportunity to serve other additional high acuity populations.
Finally, we continue to make progress in both our provider and consumer engagement efforts during the quarter. We remain on track to achieve our 2015 goals in these areas, and are excited by the opportunity to accelerate these efforts through the Humana acquisition.
I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering yet another strong quarter for Aetna. I am confident we have the right vision to be a leader in the changing health care marketplace, we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy, we will continue to be disciplined across all of our lines of business, we will close and successfully integrate the proposed Humana acquisition, and we can exceed $7.40 of operating earnings per share in 2015.
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who\'ll provide additional insight into our second quarter results, our updated 2015 outlook, and the financial aspects of our proposed Humana acquisition. Shawn?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2015 operating earnings of $722 million, and operating earnings per share of $2.05. Aetna\'s operating results continued to be supported by strong revenue growth, cash flow, and operating margins.
I\'ll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our top line performance for the quarter was solid. Medical membership held steady at approximately 23.7 million members as growth in Commercial ASC and Government membership offset declines in our small group and middle market Commercial Insured businesses. We grew operating revenue to a record quarterly level of over $15.1 billion, driven by higher premium yields and year-over-year growth in medical membership.
From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pre-tax operating margin was 8.7% for the quarter, 110 basis point year-over-year improvement. Our second quarter total medical benefit ratio was 81.1%, a strong result that benefited from continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable reserve development.
Our operating expense ratio was 18.3%, a 70-basis point increase over the second quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of continued investment spending on our growth initiatives and lower than projected operating revenue.
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to first quarter 2015 dates of service.
Additionally, our days claims payable were approximately 52 days at the end of the quarter. While sequentially lower, this metric is at a healthy level and the expected decline is consistent with improved processing times and our insured membership growth profile in the second quarter. Note that our days claims payable has increased by over four days as compared to the prior-year quarter.
Turning to cash flow and capital, operating cash flows remain strong. On a year-to-date basis, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were over 1.2 times operating earnings. We continue to project that our full-year 2015 Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows will exceed our 2015 operating earnings.
Our share repurchases during the quarter were constrained by the proposed Humana acquisition. We did, however, repurchase over 900,000 shares in the quarter for $100 million and distributed another $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend.
As disclosed previously, our ability to repurchase shares prior to the closing of the Humana acquisition will be limited. In summary, we are quite pleased with our second quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. I will now discuss the key drivers of our second quarter performance in greater detail.
Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial membership declined by 61,000 members during the quarter, as declines in our Commercial Insured business more than offset gains in our Commercial ASC membership. The declines in Commercial Insured membership were largely driven by our small group and middle markets businesses, a direct result of the previously disclosed pricing actions to improve performance in this block.
Attrition in our individual business was consistent with our previously communicated projections. As we continue to monitor our Commercial membership base, we remain pleased with the indicators on membership attraction and selection as well as overall performance.
Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.8% for the quarter, a 120 basis point increase over the same period last year on a reported basis; however, it is important to note the year-over-year increase in our reported Commercial MBR is essentially a timing issue reflecting our updated view on ACA risk adjustment payables.
Simply stated, if we remove all 3R adjustments booked in the second quarter, but related to prior-periods, our second quarter 2015 Commercial MBR would have been essentially equivalent to our second quarter 2014 Commercial MBR. This underlying performance is consistent with our projections for the quarter and leaves us well-positioned in the Commercial business over the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. It is also worth noting that as of the end of Q2, we have not booked any receivable related to risk corridors for either 2014 or 2015.
Moving on from the 3Rs. Medical cost trends continue to be moderate, and based on year-to-date experience, we now project that Aetna\'s 2015 core Commercial medical cost trend will be at the low-end of our projected range of 6% to 7%.
Another important growth lever is our Government business, which grew by 66,000 members in the quarter. Medicare Advantage grew by 5,000 members. Medicare Supplement grew by 19,000 members, and Medicaid membership also grew by 42,000 members. Of note, Medicaid membership is now up 4% year-over-year, despite the exit from the Delaware Medicaid contract at the end of last year.
Our second quarter 2015 Government premiums were $5.7 billion, and our Government medical benefit ratio was 80.3% in the quarter, a 620 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Drivers of this excellent result include excellent performance in Medicare; a demonstration of operating improvements in our individual Medicare Advantage business, including strong revenue performance and continued favorable medical cost trends as our initiatives to lower costs continue to exceed our projections; continued strong performance in our group Medicare Advantage business; as well as improved margins in our PDP businesses as our product redesign and network re-contracting efforts improved margins versus the prior-year quarter. Additionally, we saw continued strong performance in Medicaid, driven by favorable prior-period reserve development and continued improvement in a select number of our Medicaid contracts.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure, and liquidity, all continue to be very strong. At June 30, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 34%.
Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $576 million. We reduced outstanding debt by approximately $300 million. We repurchased over 900,000 shares for $100 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. After other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $100 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was 349 million at June 30.
As a result of our second quarter performance, we are increasing our 2015 operating earnings per share guidance to at least $7.40 per share. This is the sixth consecutive quarter where we have met or exceeded consensus in increased guidance. This guidance increase also speaks to the strength of the underlying business, as we are overcoming headwinds related to an updated view of ACA risk adjuster payments, a larger than projected rate decrease in Kentucky, and a higher weighted average share count than contemplated in our previous projections.
Further, our updated guidance formulation where we have provided a minimum projected performance level acknowledges that there could be meaningful upside opportunities to our projections over the remainder of the year, including accrual of 2014 and 2015 risk corridor receivables, our current estimates indicate that we could be owed well in excess of $100 million related to 2014 alone. We expect we will have some additional clarity on this program in mid-August.
Actions taken to better understand the health of our ACA compliant populations, which could lower our projected 2015 risk adjuster payables and continued performance across our Government blocks of business that is better than our projections. Potentially offsetting these opportunities is the ever present risk that medical cost trends could increase more than we have projected.
Our updated 2015 guidance is also influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our second quarter membership results, we now project that our year-end medical membership will be between 23.4 million and 23.5 million members, down approximately 250,000 members from our last projection.
For the remainder of the year, we now project that growth in Government membership will be more than offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including in our individual, small group and student health businesses.
Primarily, based on lower membership and mix, we have revised our outlook on full-year 2015 operating revenue, which we now project to be in the range of $60 billion to $61 billion. Based on our strong second quarter results, we now project our full-year total medical benefit ratio will be 81.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points, and that our full-year 2015 Commercial MBR will be essentially flat when compared to the 2014 Commercial MBR of 80.2%.
Primarily, as a result of our updated revenue projections and continued investment spending on our strategic initiatives, we now project that our operating expense ratio will be in the range of 18.5% to 19% for the full-year. We now project our pre-tax operating margin to be at least 7.9%, consistent with our high single-digit target, with operating earnings of at least $2.6 billion.
Finally, in light of the pending Humana transaction, we now expect that we will use free cash flow this year to eliminate any projected commercial paper borrowings, which will leave us with a parent cash balance of approximately $200 million at year-end. Our 2015 share count is now projected to be approximately 353 million shares, reflecting our limited ability to repurchase shares as a result of the proposed Humana acquisition.
I\'d like to finish with a few words on the proposed acquisition of Humana. Mark outlined the strategic merits of the acquisition at the outset this morning, and I\'d like to spend a moment on the projected financial benefits. Humana has deep experience in Medicare Advantage, a business that we think can continue to grow membership at mid to high single-digit rates with sustainable margins in the mid-single-digit range. We remain confident that we are purchasing a premier provider in this growing business.
Humana\'s Commercial and Medicaid businesses will substantially benefit from Aetna\'s expertise and we are confident in our ability to improve performance in these businesses. There is substantial synergy value that will be unlocked through this transaction that we are confident we can achieve and will enable us to deliver more cost-effective products for consumers.
And, finally, we have not included any revenue or health care services synergies in our outlook, which should ultimately provide upside to our projections and enhance our growth profile over the longer term.
Our experience in successfully integrating the Coventry acquisition and the strength of our management team gives us great confidence that we have the right people and processes to manage the Humana integration to a successful outcome. We are building a dedicated team with experienced executives and operators to manage each step of the integration and have great confidence in our ability to execute our plans. We look forward to moving this process to a successful closing in the second half of 2016, so that we may begin to realize the value proposition for our customers, members, and shareholders.
As we look to the balance of 2015, the fundamentals of Aetna\'s business remain strong and we are confident in our operating EPS projection of at least $7.40 per share. The Humana acquisition will only serve to enhance our position as a leader in the transformation of the health care system, delivering more cost-effective products to customers, and our ability to achieve and exceed our long-term growth objectives.
I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?
Thomas F. Cowhey - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question, so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions. Operator, the first question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus on the MBR. Could you comment on the sustainability of MBR on the Government side? Shawn, you mentioned the headwind from Kentucky rates. I\'m wondering if there are other factors that we should consider?
And then on the Commercial side of the MBR, is the membership mix that you are seeing, the departures in membership, are you seeing that be favorable to your margin profile in the Commercial side of the business? Thanks.
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Yep, thanks, David. Let me start with the second one, because clearly the answer is yes. As we mentioned, we\'ve pushed price, we\'re seeing a little bit of volume pressure, but because of the way this is shaking out, we\'re doing fine from a margin dollars perspective, so that\'s going the right way.
On the Government business, I think it\'s worth commenting on, really, why it\'s performing so well and then talk a little bit about the outlook. I would say, first, that both Medicare and Medicaid are performing very well. The way this is showing up, has been another quarter of very strong prior-period development. Obviously, leading the pack on Medicaid is Kentucky, that continues to perform very well, and as you alluded to, we will have a rate reset in the third quarter.
Medicare is really firing on all cylinders, as I mentioned. The individual MA business, the group MA business are performing very well, and I think that\'s the result of investments that we made even more than a year ago, but looking at making sure that we\'re doing as good a job as we can on revenue and medical management. I also mentioned the PDP margins, the actions we took to re-contract the network and do some product redesign have really taken hold, and that business is performing better.
I think the thing I don\'t want to get lost here, obviously, is the fact that the Medicare business is running so much meaningfully better and very well in the second quarter. I think that\'s a nice thing to be taking into 2016 when you think about the bids that we submitted during the second quarter.
You know, in terms of our outlook, we are not projecting that this same very favorable level will show up in the second half of the year. Part of this is we do want to be careful not to get too far ahead of ourselves and we\'re not making any assumption in terms of these ongoing very strong levels of PPD, for instance.
You mentioned the Kentucky rate reset. That is certainly a meaningful item in the second half of the year, and also there tends to be a little bit of seasonal pressure on the Medicare MBR in the second half of the year, just related to the risk scores in the population.
So, I do think, we still will have a very good result. In fact, our forecast for these businesses, certainly, has them squarely in the target margin range for the full-year. I do expect that the second half performance will not be as good as the first half; but again, these businesses are still performing exceptionally well.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC
Hello, everybody. Thanks. First of all, just of the 3R accrual, I appreciate the commentary of how the new information has affected your 2014 assumptions and accruals. How is that reflected in your 2015 accruals? Have you made any changes to what you\'re doing for 2015 as a result of the information on 2014?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Yeah, absolutely. So, to your point, when the data came out on June 30, we recognized that we needed to increase the risk adjustment accrual related to 2014 by about $60 million.
The next logical question is, what does that data tell you about your 2015 accrual? And we have largely assumed that in our guidance, and what we booked for the second quarter, that the 2015 risk adjustment payables will be more or less at the same PMPM rate as the 2014 payable, despite the fact that we are making substantially more investment spending to improve that result and the potential for risk pool improvement in 2015.
So, I think it speaks, again, to the strength of the underlying businesses. Not only do we have the prior-period sort of catch up adjustments we\'ve discussed, but the very fact that we\'re in essence sort of on plan and flat year-over-year, that\'s being done, in essence, in the face of a higher outlook for 2015 which, again, I think speaks directly to how well the underlying Commercial business is performing.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And maybe as my follow-up question, I\'m going to take a shot at this, I think the two questions that we\'ve generally gotten since you guys have announced the Humana deal are around how can we get confident in your anticipated accretion, given the volatility in Humana\'s results, and how can we get comfortable around the regulatory path we\'re going through? I guess, since you announced the deal, there\'s been the announcement of Humana\'s second quarter results and there\'s also been, obviously, another deal announced so that we now know we\'ve got two big deals before the DOJ. Any update or any words that you would offer to try to add to comfort around either of those issues?
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
A.J., Mark. On the regulatory approach, we\'ve already filed our HSR. We\'re starting to file in a number of states. We need 20 state approvals for Form As. We\'ll file our S4 in the next couple of weeks. And so all of that, since the process is underway, we\'ve engaged in conversations with insurance commissioners, with governors, with Washington, and we are most concerned about staying on our strategy, our point of view.
We\'re doing deep analysis, even deeper than we did before the deal on a number of competitors by market the plans offered, the opportunity to divest. I think if you all do your homework like you have been on all of the competitors in each market and look at the markets where we may need to consider divestiture, there are plenty of competitors left in the market.
And so, I think our comfort is in the actual analysis at the end of the day, we will still be 8% of the overall Medicare market on a combined basis. We will be big in some markets where we may be have to divest. There will be plenty of competitors in each market.
And quite frankly, I think the bigger issue at the market level, where this analysis will occur, is the level of market share that the blues hold, which is really the dominant competitor in each market. I\'ll turn it over to Shawn for comments on Humana\'s performance today.
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Yes. So, on the accretion, I would say, there\'s really three things that certainly give me comfort, that are all wrapped in the wrapper of, I think, we have a very reasonable and achievable financial case for them.
First, we\'re not assuming overly rosy growth rates or margin rates for their business, so we have a very reasonable, I think, and achievable projection for sort of the base case. I think our synergy assumption is a very achievable assumption and we certainly have proven that we can deliver and exceed, based on Coventry. But, I think we have a very relevant base case assumption around synergies.
And finally, we do have, I think, we\'ve also made a reasonable provision for any disruption that might occur in a large acquisition. So, I think the accretion really is premised on a case that we want to be able to have a high degree of confidence that we can deliver to you. And we would have every intention to try to not only achieve that but sort of beat that case in terms of what we end up producing.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Sticking with Medicare, I guess, you talk about a mid-single-digit margin. So, I\'m just curious, what you think the long-term sustainable margin is for that business?
And then how does scale play into that? Are there benefits? Are there national benefits? Are there things that you can do with PBM capabilities to capture more of that margin? Or is MA really a business we should think about as mid-single-digit in each and every county that you guys bid?
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
So, Josh, I believe that mid-single-digit will continue to be, and we view as possible for the Medicare business going forward, we believe that\'s an appropriate return. And we can price well into that.
I think the real issue is at the local market level, what our presence is and our ability to partner with providers on keeping medical costs under control going forward, and our ability to get the information necessary to drive star ratings and risk adjusters.
If we get paid for the risk that we\'re assuming, then we can manage the population more effectively. And so, the model really is shifting on underwriting in Medicare from one of creating balanced risk pools to one of getting paid for the risk we\'re assuming. And so, that really depends at the local market level.
I think what you\'re seeing in our performance so far this year, is all the work that we\'ve done underlying those provider relationships and those collaborations we\'ve been talking about for a number of years. In addition to all the work we\'ve been doing on the star ratings, we literally double our presence in the markets with the Humana acquisition to make that work, and at that level, market penetration is going to make a difference.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. That\'s helpful. And then, just, Shawn, I don\'t know if there\'s an easy way to do this, but is there a way to figure out sort of, what is the core within that $7.40 guidance this year, what\'s the core, sort of, ongoing EPS growth or EPS total for the year, if we sort of exclude some of the out of period 3Rs and that sort of stuff, is there a way to sort of think about what core EPS is?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Well, I mean, the most direct out of period, is, if you look at what we did this quarter, for example, on the 3Rs, the amount that\'s going back to 2014 is roughly $80 million. So, that\'s about a $0.14 bad guide that\'s going back to that. But, I want to be really clear that we actually \xe2\x80\x93 our guidance presumes that, even including that, we can get back to sort of, in essence, a flat Commercial MBR. And when you look at where we are year-to-date and you adjust for these things, you can see that that\'s in essence where we are. But, as it pertains to the 3Rs, that\'s really the magnitude of the adjustment that goes back to 2014.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And there\'s no sort of other extraordinary favorable development or anything like that that we should think of as not really run rate for this year?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Well, we always talked about the prior-year development. But no, there\'s nothing extraordinary on a year-over-year basis that I would call out.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks, good morning. So, just maybe, first, on cost trend, you\'re now down into the low-end versus maybe previously the lower half. Maybe discuss what you\'re seeing related to cost trend and what are the actual moving parts that are driving it towards that low-end versus your initial expectations? Thanks.
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Yeah, so Andy, as you\'ll recall, and I alluded to, we had assumed that we would have an uptick in utilization trend this year, we had included that in our forward pricing. And in the first \xe2\x80\x93 at least in the first half of the year, thus far, we\'re really not seeing that.
In our forecasting, we had assumed that we would see that more on the outpatient side and while an outpatient trend is still positive we\'re not seeing any of the acceleration that we would have put into pricing. So, really what we\'re seeing is a stable continuation, sort of the trend trajectory we\'ve been on. And, again, in the first half of the year, not seeing that uptick that we had put into pricing going forward.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Maybe just somewhat related to that you did implement pricing actions related to your middle market and small group, which seems to be driving the desired outcomes for your margin expansion maybe at the expense of membership. It sounds like that membership pressure will continue in the second half of the year; but clearly, you\'re doing quite well on margins, so how should we think about that business going forward? Maybe heading into next year, maybe a little anniversarying of this year\'s losses, but are you at a place where you\'re comfortable with the margins, especially given the lower cost trend where you think you can maybe price a return to membership growth? Or is the market still competitive in those areas?
Karen S. Rohan - President
Hi, it\'s Karen. Relative to your question, first I would say that the underlying performance of this business is performing exactly where we thought it would be. And you\'re right, we have had that volume pressure.
We expect to see in our forecast reflects continued pressure in the second half of the year. We are at the point though that we expect to be \xe2\x80\x93 the market remains competitive, but we expect to continue to price for margin over membership; but we expect to, in 2016, to start performing better on this business and start showing better growth. There\'s a lot of churn in the 2 to 50 and the 51 to 100, and we have the ability to underwrite that 51 to 100 business through keep what you have activities and we are looking to maintain that and grow that into 2016.
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Yeah. And so, Andy, again, I would say this is about as clear a case as there is, of sort of the evidence of favoring margin over membership, and there would be no fundamental change in that philosophy going forward. These things tend to work through the rate correction cycle and have these sort of volume impacts, but tend to stabilize more once you get through a full annual cycle of the re-pricing.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. Thanks. Just wanted to understand around the 3Rs, you said you\'re taking actions to better understand the health of your businesses. Is it basically like a coding initiative? What exactly are you doing to get in here and to better understand that population? And is there any way to kind of frame or quantify what you think the benefits could be?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
So, in general, Kevin, you\'re on the right track, what we\'re talking about there are the kinds of things you do to ensure that you\'re getting fair and complete payment for the risk profile of your membership.
We\'re investing more energy into that end money in 2015 than we did last year. But again, the fact that this is a sort of zero-sum game amongst participants, I want to be a little bit careful that despite the investment how much we can really bank on, in terms of getting net improvement.
So, I\'d hesitate to speculate on an amount right now, and I\'d go back to what we have largely assumed in our 2015 forecast is that the same level or the same rate at which we saw payables end up at 2014, we\'ve largely assumed the continuation of that rate in 2015 with no real improvement from any of this incremental investment and no real improvement from the potential for the risk pool that this is all settled up and to get better. Obviously, that\'s a bit speculative, so I would never bank on that. But, we have largely assumed the run rate we just observed in 2014.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. And then just a follow-up on the investment theme. You mentioned a few times, G&A investments for growth. Could you just give a little more color as to what exactly you\'re spending on and what businesses that refers to?
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes, Kevin, what we\'re investing in is in our consumer business, which we will launch six new products in four different markets in 2016, for 1/1/2016, on the public exchange and off the public exchange for the individual market. We\'ll also be launching a private exchange version for small group in a number of markets throughout 2016. We continue to invest in our footprint on Medicare, but we\'re evaluating that as we consider the integration issues around Humana and the opportunities that reside there, and we will continue to invest in our provider relationships as we build out more joint ventures and ACOs, a la the Innovation Health Plan model.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Great. Thanks.

Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks. First just a clarification, on the 3R guidance and your overall earnings guidance for the year, you have not included anything for risk corridors in your guidance. If you were to be paid the $100 million, or roughly $0.20 in earnings, that would be on top of the $7.40 earnings guidance you have?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
That is correct.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then the second question about next year, looking at next year, the Part D bids declined on average 7.9% or 5.7% after normalization. Can you tell us why you think those bids declined so much on average and if you think that that\'s something that was expected, or should have been expected, based on the performance of Part D this year?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
The one thing I would tell you is, there\'s a lot of mechanics behind that sort of national average bid process. And I think every year, we\'ve seen people taking action around product design, network design, and whatnot, that have probably brought that national average bid in lower than maybe people would have thought at the beginning. That result came in largely where we had projected it was going to come in for our book of business, but it really is the ongoing actions of people to deliver a more cost-effective product to consumers.
Karen S. Rohan - President
Yeah. And I would just add that our bids were favorably positioned to the national average bid and that we were below the low income benchmark in 33 regions out of the 34 regions, and right in line with our expectations.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC
Yeah, thanks. Good morning. This question is firstly about your Commercial MLR guidance that you\'ve updated to 80.2%, and it\'s encouraging that it\'s flat year-over-year, but as you look back to when you were guiding at the beginning of this year, were you embedding or expecting any improvements firstly in the public exchange loss ratio from 2014 to 2015? I think you had expected or have baked in breakeven?
And then secondly, on the Commercial loss ratio, you had some issues on small group last year, you repriced the bulk, seemed very conservative. Is there any potential for MLR improvement and overall, is that 80.2% conservative? Not that it\'s a bad result, I\'m just curious if there\'s any upside on that?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Well, like I said, there\'s always upside to any of these estimates. I guess as well, like I said, there\'s always the ever present risk of trend changing. But on the Commercial MLR, I think what I would say about that is, we have pushed the re-pricing in, and what we\'ve done this year in terms of trying to position ourselves appropriately for the 3Rs is a pretty significant amount of money, and really the fact that we\'re coming in at initial guidance, again, speaks to the fact that the underlying business, both as a result of the pricing actions that we took last year and sort of what we\'re observing on trend is running at or better than expected in most instances.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC
And then on the public exchanges, if it was breakeven last year, once you take all this 3R accounting and everything, what is being embedded right now into your full-year expectation for margin, and then -
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
When you look at 2015, even without the risk corridor, this business would be slightly profitable, even with this sort of higher risk adjustment payable outlook.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC
Okay. So, with the $100 million and your $277 million, which seems like really conservative on payables, there\'s potential for low single-digit margin?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Yeah. And again, honestly, I thought we were conservative on 2014, and so that, going back to Kevin\'s question, has sort of positioned our viewpoint and continuing to be cautious in this area and what we\'ve accrued for 2015.
And on a program that\'s really, still, in some ways, in its infancy, I don\'t want to get too far ahead of myself in sort of predicting that there\'s conservatism in that risk adjustment accrual. Clearly, the risk corridor would be meaningful upside, if we were able to recognize a good part of that or all of it.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC
Thanks, Shawn. Appreciate it.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC
Hi there. You guys, I think, have already submitted a lot of your individual bids for 2016. Can you go back or do you need to go back, now that you have this revised outlook on the 3Rs and renegotiate kind of what the states or the Feds, with respect to your public exchange pricing?
Karen S. Rohan - President
Yeah. Christine, we have gone back to the states, where we could, and we have re-priced the \xe2\x80\x93 in a number of states, reflecting our risk adjuster. So, that has been done and we have now new prices in those states.
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Yeah. And Christine, the thing I would add, is interestingly enough, the variance that we had for 2014 was actually more in small group than it was individual. So, as Karen mentioned, there\'s always moving parts in individual, but we\'re not as deep into that pricing process and in fact, it is concentrated in a few places. So, I\'m comfortable that we can reflect this in our pricing and this will be fine for 2016.
Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. So, is it reasonable to assume that both individual and small group profitability can improve next year?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Yes. It would be reasonable to assume that.
Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. And then final question for me is, how do I think about the Kentucky drag with respect to margins there, as you absorb those rate cuts?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
What I would say is that what we forecast, sort of post-this rate cut, is still a profitable contract in Kentucky. I would say the margin profile going forward, though, looks a lot more like a typical Medicaid margin as compared to where we\'ve been.
The drag in this year is probably plus or minus the $0.10 that we talked about, and that\'s obviously for half a year, but the contract is still a very good contract. It\'s just not going to be at the margin level that it\'s been at.
Christine M. Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Thank you. I\'ll just stay on the Kentucky topic for a minute. The $0.10 per quarter impact is a little bit larger than I expected, given the scale of this contract for your overall book of business. So, what range was the MLR running in, prior to the rate changes?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Well, we\'ve talked about that, this has been, certainly, well below the mid-80%s in the past. But, let me be clear, and I apologize if I misspoke, the $0.10 is for the second half of 2015, so it actually represents two quarters.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. That\'s helpful. And now that national account season is wrapping up, can you give us an update on how that\'s going for Aetna?
Karen S. Rohan - President
Yeah, let me just update you from the last time we talked. As I mentioned, the activity level was slightly better than last year. We are having one of our better sales years, with above average close rates. However, we had a large number of accounts that, as we talked about, have moved to slice business. But the real relevant metric here is on revenue. And we are seeing our private exchange growth revenue exceed the losses that we have on our ACO losses. So, we expect that \xe2\x80\x93 with that revenue growth to exceed the ACS losses.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
And how big is your private exchange book right now?
Karen S. Rohan - President
Right now...
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
We have about 190,000 private exchange members right now. And we can get the revenue number for you offline. A good chunk of that is insured and some of that is self-insured.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
All right. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Yes. Good morning. Thank you. Sorry, let me just, on the last question, if I could, so what you\'re saying is that you\'re losing ASO enrollment on some of your slice contracts, but you expect that to be offset by growth in private exchange, so that you think you\'ll be flat in January, is that right?
Karen S. Rohan - President
On a revenue basis.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay.
Karen S. Rohan - President
So, on a revenue basis, you have to look at fair and that net would be up on those two metrics.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Okay. Got it. On a separate topic, can you just comment on where you are relative to the minimum MLRs? I mean, we\'ve talked about upside potential, when does that and where does that become a limiting factor either in Commercial, individual, small group, large group or Medicare Advantage? I\'m not really asking for specific numbers there, just a directional sense?
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think what we\'ve learned over the last four years, Matt, is that when we price this properly into the business going forward, think of it as an option on risk that we can come very close and so our number is not meaningful at all. It\'s very insignificant on a MLR rebate.
I think the only place we had some concern was on the health insurance exchange business, but that all got factored into risk adjusters and all the 3Rs, that was a little bit of a concern as we were working through that. But again, the overall number across all the business, very insignificant.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.
But am I right, you\'re managing it so you\'re very close to those floors, is the way that you\'re pricing it?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Well, I think, Matt, the fact that the accruals are not all that significant right now would speak to the fact that there is breathing space...
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay.
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
...in a lot of places between sort of that accrual and where we are today. To your point, it\'s clearly a factor in the business going forward, but to Mark\'s point, we\'ve been able to position ourselves really every year except the first year of this program for this to have a fairly modest impact around the business. So, it\'s certainly something that is relevant in the business, it\'s certainly something we think about, but we\'re really not right up against it right now.
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
At a higher level, Matt, this has really created stability and pricing across a lot of markets, and we\'ve seen that play out where there isn\'t as much buying share anymore because you can\'t price up in the next year to get it back.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Gary Paul Taylor - JPMorgan
Hi. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, I just wanted to ask one other question on the 3Rs. Per the slide, you\'re accruing the 2015 reinsurance recoverables at 65%, and I believe the initial CMS guidance is still 50%, unless I\'m mistaken. And I know obviously 2014 ended up trending much better than the initial expectation. So, just my question was, on that 65%, do you have some guidance from CMS around that, is that an estimate based on what, could you help us understand that?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
So, we have gotten some direction is what I would say. One of the pieces of good news that was included in the June 30 release of the 2Rs was that in essence that the 2014 reinsurance program, there was a surplus of about $1.8 billion in that program. And they were quite explicit that any amounts that were not going to be used to make payments in 2014 would be used to make payments in the reinsurance year of 2015. And so, by looking at the magnitude of that and looking at the size of the, what we think the pool is, to your point, much akin to what we did in 2014 and looking at this issue, we concluded that this was sort of our best estimate of what would get paid out via that program.
Gary Paul Taylor - JPMorgan
Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Thomas F. Cowhey - Vice President-Investor Relations
Worth noting, this is Tom, that most of that accrual happens in the back half rather than in the second quarter because of the way that the reinsurance timing works when you get the claims in.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Wright with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT
Thanks. Good morning. Just with all the PPRD and the risks, 3R adjustments, is there a view on what the core earnings power for 2015 should be to move to model 2016 and beyond?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Well, like I said, I don\'t think we\'re sort of what we\'re talking about in the, at least $7.40 is all that far off sort of where we would think about a jump off point. Obviously, you know our conventions around forecasting prior-year development, so you\'d have to sort of think that particular item through. We\'ve talked a little bit about the 3Rs; but I wouldn\'t sort of direct you in a meaningful way either direction of that $7.40.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT
Okay. And then, this might be helpful for all of us with regard to Humana. Could you at least kind of give us what you\'re thinking about for a starting point for their earnings in 2015?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Well, like we said...
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT
When you\'re modeling your accretion...
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
the guidance that we provided for this year was certainly consistent with the diligence that we did going through that, so I think where they are, is as good a starting point as any.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT
So, you\'re not taking any haircuts from that as the starting point?
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
Not at this point.
Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT
Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.
Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Good morning. Thanks. Just on the 3Rs again and really just on reinsurance. I guess, is there one area, in particular, within sort of medical costs that\'s driving that at this point, is it pharmacy or something else? And then, a big picture question related to that, I guess we\'re sort of one year away, we\'ve got 2016 left with all 3Rs, but when I look at a reinsurance recoverable this year north of $500 million, I guess, do we, at this point, is there a functioning ACA marketplace without the 3Rs, or rather two of them, in your opinion? Thanks.
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
As it relates to the reinsurance drivers, it is just high cost cases and some of that indeed is pharmacy, but they\'re just really people that go over that threshold, there are a whole host of different cases, it\'s normal to the course of business that we run on a day-in, day-out basis. We always have high cost cases.
We generally price those into the premium across the total population. So, what happens when the reinsurance recoveries come out of a separate category, a separate way of accruing, they have to go into pricing. And so, we\'ll see how that plays out as we get ready for the next pricing period, but that will be the overall impact, is that you\'ll see every \xe2\x80\x93 so risk corridors and reinsurance recoveries will have to get priced into rates.
Shawn M. Guertin - EVP, Chief Financial & Enterprise Risk Officer
And I think, Brian (sic) [Chris], you certainly saw that one of the sort of reconciling items, if you will, in terms of rate increases from 2014 to 2015 was the change in the reinsurance program. That is, again, to Mark\'s point, contemplated again in 2015 to 2016 pricing. And, for the most part, that is what the market is doing. So, I think ultimately the answer to your question is, yes, based on the fact that this is largely got into sort of the sustainable pricing in the markets, I think it\'s reasonable to assume that the marketplace will function post-reinsurance.
Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Got it. Thanks a lot.
Thomas F. Cowhey - Vice President-Investor Relations
