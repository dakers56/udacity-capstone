2013 Annual Shareholder Meeting
May 17, 2013  9:30 am ET
Executives
Mark T. Bertolini - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, Chairman of Executive Committee and Member of Investment & Finance Committee
Mark T. Bertolini
Good morning, and welcome. It\'s now 9:30 and time to call the meeting to order. The 2013 Annual Meeting of Aetna\'s shareholders is now in session. I am Mark Bertolini, Chairman, CEO and President of Aetna. Next to me is Judith Jones, our Vice President and Corporate Secretary, who\'ll act as Secretary for this meeting.
I\'d like to call your attention to the agenda and rules of conduct for the meeting which were on your seat. We appreciate your compliance with the rules so we can have a productive meeting. I\'d like to acknowledge the directors who are here with us this morning and welcome them. Members of Aetna\'s senior management are also seated in front. Also with us are Richard [indiscernible] and David Rood from KPMG, our independent registered public accounting firm.
Before we move onto the business of the meeting, I\'d like to make a few remarks about 2012, as well as our efforts to transform the health care system in the U.S. and around the world. Aetna\'s mission is to empower people to live healthier lives.
In 2012, we helped millions of our members access the care they needed to get and stay healthy. We created new mobile technology to put the power of health in people\'s hands whenever and wherever they need it. We\'ve built new relationships with health care providers so we could start working together to manage costs while improving patient care. We announced plans to acquire Coventry Health Care as part of a diversified growth strategy. Our acquisition of Coventry will strengthen our geographic presence in key commercial markets and strengthen our customer base in the government sector. And we generated full year operating earnings of $1.77 billion or $5.13 per share. These accomplishments are just a few of the ways we kept our promises to our customers, while delivering a solid year of shareholder returns to our investors.
The Affordable Care Act is drawing unprecedented attention to how we access and pay for health care. As the country prepares for implementing the new health care exchanges, we expect consumers to demand more transparency about cost and quality. With more of their own money at risk, consumers will start to ask tough questions about why health care costs so much. We will be engaged in that conversation, and we continue to focus on providing affordable access to quality health care services.
We already are breaking new ground of customers and health care providers who agree that health care costs more than it should. We have created new tools to help consumers make better buying decisions about where and when they access medical care. We are changing the way health care is delivered and paid for by focusing on paying for quality rather than quantity. Innovative new arrangements call accountable care organizations, allow us to work closely with the provider community to develop partnerships with doctors who are compensated for helping people get healthier. We have 20 of these new accountable care relationships in place and continue to forge new agreements.
We are also expanding other forms of value-based care programs. For example, we have 34 patient centered medical home arrangements and 74 agreements with providers who have committed to provide value-based care to Medicare advantage patients. We are well positioned for 2013. Our acquisition of Coventry brought our medical membership to 22 million people and expands our local market presence in key growth areas. Coventry also added competitive advantage in pricing -- price-sensitive customer markets, and beyond 2014, we believe our diversified business portfolio will help us capitalize on growth opportunities and limit exposure in segments undergoing significant change or temporary contraction.
I am very proud of what we have accomplished and see a bright future ahead of us. Before closing this section, I also want to thank Aetna\'s employees for their continued hard work and dedication to putting our customers at the center of everything we do. Thank you for your continued investment in Aetna and confidence in our future.
So let\'s begin the business portion of the meeting. This meeting is governed by Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law and Aetna bylaws. Mrs. Jones has advised me that a majority of the votes entitled to be cast are present at this meeting, and we have a quorum. Notice of the meeting was distributed on April 5, 2013, to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2013. Some logistics before we begin.
We have 7 business items on the agenda and you\'ll have a chance to ask questions relevant to each of them. To do so, please use the microphones in the center of the room. State your name and whether or not you are an -- whether you\'re an Aetna shareholder or a proxy for a shareholder. If you represent a shareholder, identify the shareholder on whose behalf you are speaking and your affiliation with the shareholder. And please direct all questions directly to me. After the business items, ballots will be distributed to those who need them. These will be collected and counted by our judge of election. After all items are acted upon, we\'ll adjourn the business portion of the meeting and respond to general questions and comments.
Under our bylaws, director nominations and other business proposals can be brought before this meeting only if our Corporate Secretary receives the nomination or proposal on writing at least 90 days before the annual meeting. No nominations or proposals received other than those outlined in the proxy statement, therefore, director nominations are closed and no other proposals may come before this meeting.
So for our first 2 agenda items, election of directors and appointment of KPMG. The proxy statement lists the 12 director nominees and contains detailed information of other qualifications and backgrounds. As reported in the proxy statement, the audit committee and board recommend approval of the appointment of KPMG as Aetna\'s independent registered public accounting firm for 2013. A fact sheet available to you today has more information on KPMG, and KPMG representatives are here if you have questions for them. Are there any questions about the election of directors of appointment -- or the appointment of KPMG? Hearing none, we\'ll move to the next agenda item.
Agenda item #3. Approval of the amendment of the amend -- amendment to the amendment -- amended Aetna Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan. The next item pertains to a proposed amendment to Aetna\'s 2010 Stock Incentive Plan. This is a plan under which we grant equity awards to Aetna managers and executives. The amendment would increase the number of shares available for future grants under the plan from approximately 7.2 million currently to approximately 13.5 million shares, raising the total number of authorized -- the shares authorized under the plan to 22 million. Are there any questions about this proposal? Seeing none, we will proceed to the next agenda item.
We have a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation. In accordance with SEC rules, our shareholders have an opportunity to cast a nonbinding advisory vote on the fiscal 2012 compensation of our named executive officers. While this vote is nonbinding, our compensation committee and the board value our shareholders\' opinions and the outcome of this vote will be taken into account when future executive compensation decisions are considered. Are there any questions regarding this nonbinding vote? Okay. Seeing none, we\'ll proceed to the next agenda item.
We have 3 shareholder proposals, which were included in the proxy statement. The first shareholder proposal was submitted by the Comptroller of the city of New York as the custodian and trustee of the New York City employees retirement system, New York City Fire Department pension fund, the New York City teachers retirement system and the New York City police pension fund, and custodians and New York City board of education and retirement system. The proposal asked the board to adopt the policy that the chair of the board be an independent director who is not a current or former employee of the company, and who\'s only nontrivial professional -- and who\'s only nontrivial professional familial of financial connections with the company or its CEO is the directorship. There\'s a representative of the proponent here to present this proposal.
Lee Bonta
Good morning, Mr. Chairman. My name is Lee Bonta, and I\'m presenting proposal 1 calling for an independent Board Chairman on behalf of New York City Comptroller, John Liu and the trustees in the New York City pension funds. The New York City funds are long-term Aetna shareholders. We believe a structure in which the CEO runs the business and is accountable to a board led by an independent chairman is in the best long-term interest of Aetna and its share owners, it\'s common sense. The role of the board is to oversee the CEO. There is an irresolvable conflict of interest when the overseen is in charge of the overseer. The consequences include higher executive compensation, lower shareholder returns, more aggressive risk taking and ultimately, less sustainable companies. Aetna\'s recently completed acquisition of Coventry Health Care and the more than 10-year average tenure of its independent directors underscore the need for an independent Chairman. In addition, we share the independent board oversights concerns raised by some shareholders in connection with Aetna\'s political spending and transparency, particularly with respect to its indirect spending through intermediaries. Following majority support for a similar proposal in 2011, the board expanded the duties of its Lead Director. But a Lead Director is not an independent Chairman who set the agenda and committee assignments and presides over meetings, to quote a Millstein Center 2009 report, "The lead director does not run the meeting. He who sits at the head of the table runs the meeting." According to a June 2012 study of 180 North American companies by GMI ratings, companies with a separate Chair and CEO perform better and are more sustainable over the longer term. The 5-year total shareholder return was found to be 28% higher and the GMI risk rating is lower at these companies. Board leadership in the U.S. is trending towards an independent chair. 21% of S&P 500 companies now have an independent chair compared to 9% in 2003. We urge the board to also take this step on behalf of Aetna and its shareholders. And we urge shareholders to support proposal 1 for an independent Chairman. Thank you.
Mark T. Bertolini
Thank you, Mr. Bonta. we -- for your perspective. The Board of Directors respectfully disagrees and proposes -- opposes this proposal for the reason stated in the proxy statement. Are there any other questions on this proposal? Okay. Seeing none, we\'ll proceed to the next agenda item.
The second shareholder proposal asked the board to take the necessary steps to eliminate each voting requirement in our charter and bylaws that currently requires more than a simple majority vote and to replace it with a requirement that calls for either a majority of the votes cast for and against applicable proposals or a simple majority in compliance with applicable laws. Do we have a proposal here? Someone here will present that proposal.
Lee Bonta
Mr. Chairman, good morning, Lee Bonta again. I am a proxy presenting proposal 2, simple majority vote right on behalf of John Sheridan of Redondo Beach, California, he sponsored this proposal. Resolve: shareholders request that our board take the steps necessary so that each voting requirement in our charter and bylaws that calls for a greater than simple majority vote be eliminated and replaced by a requirement for a majority of the votes cast for and against applicable proposals or a simple majority in compliance with applicable laws. It\'s necessary, this means, to post a standard to a majority of the votes cast for and against such proposals consistent with applicable laws. Share owners are willing to pay a premium for shares of corporations that have excellent corporate governance. Supermajority voting requirements have been found to be 1 of 6 entrenching mechanisms that are negatively related to company performance according to, "what matters in corporate governance," by Lucian Bebchuk of the Harvard Law School. This proposal topic 1 from 74% to 88% support of Weyerhaeuser, Alcoa, Waste Management, Goldman Sachs, FirstEnergy, McGraw-Hill and Macy\'s. Currently, a 1% minority can frustrate the will of our 66% shareholder majority that seeks to improve our corporate governance. Supermajority requirements are arguably most often used to block initiatives supported by most share owners. Please vote to protect shareholders value proposal 2, simple majority vote right.
Mark T. Bertolini
Thank you, Mr. Bonta for presenting Mr. Sheridan\'s proposal. The Board of Directors respectfully disagrees and opposes this proposal for the reasons stated in the proxy statement. Are there any other questions for this proposal? Seeing none, we\'ll proceed to the next agenda item.
The third shareholder proposal asked the board to amend its existing political contributions policy to include additional provisions regarding board oversight of Aetna\'s political expenditures. This proposal is submitted by the Unitarian Universalist Association and Congregations. Is there a representative here of the proponent to present this proposal? Mr. Bonta?
Lee Bonta
Yes. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Mr. Chairman, members of the board and fellow shareholders, thank you for the opportunity to speak to you. I am Lee Bonta and I\'m a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Tampa, a member congregation of the Unitarian Universalist Association, the share owners that I represent today. I hereby move our proposal, shareholder proposal #3 on your proxy card, which requests that the company amend its political contributions policy to provide restricted board oversight of Aetna\'s political expenditures. One of UUA\'s guiding principles calls for us to uphold the democratic process and society at large. We are deeply concerned that excessive money in politics can corrupt the democratic process, especially that comes without full transparency. Following a dialogue between shareholders and Aetna management earlier this year, the company improved its disclosures on the website. This was encouraging. However, since then, research conducted by the CtW Investment Group has raised serious concerns in a letter dated -- in a letter to our Lead Director, Edward Ludwig, dated April 17, 2013. They pointed out that the company\'s political disclosure reports since 2005 are inconsistent with their federal filings. Federal board oversight is made more urgent by last year\'s revelation that Aetna had contributed over $3 million to the American Action Network without disclosure, as called for, in a 2007 agreement with Mercy Investments Services. Equally concerning was the company\'s $4 million contribution to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for its, "voter education program." The company is expected to explain to the investors how this payment advance the best interest of its shareholders. This initiative is especially concerning, given the Chamber\'s website description of its voter education as funding to defeat legislators of predominantly one-party for the positions on health care. All of this suggests serious weaknesses in management\'s controls and the board\'s oversight of political spending. We believe that robust board oversight is necessary to ensure that corporate political expenditures are in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. Without such oversight, corporate funds can be used to pursue private, managerial preferences or activities that are not aligned with the company\'s business strategy or values. Therefore, we urge shareholders to support this proposal. Thank you.
Mark T. Bertolini
Thank you, Mr. Bonta, for your perspective, the Board of Directors respectfully disagrees and opposes this proposal for reasons stated in the proxy statement. Are there any other questions on this proposal? Seeing none, we\'ll now take care of any necessary balloting. If you have already voted by proxy, there is no need to vote now unless you want to change your earlier vote. If you do want to make a change or you need a ballot to vote now, please raise your hand. Okay. The board has appointed Debra Baker as judge of election. She is an independent consultant of Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. Before our Q&A period begins, I\'d like to report that based on the number of proxies received as of 9:30 a.m. this morning, Ms. Baker has advised that all director nominees have been elected as Directors to serve until the 2014 Annual Meeting and have not on majority vote standard; KPMG has been approved as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2013; shareholders have approved the amendment to the 2010 Aetna Stock Incentive Plan; shareholders have approved the fiscal 2012 compensation of our executive officers; shareholders have rejected the proposal on adoption of an independent chair policy; shareholders have approved the proposal calling for an amendment to our charter and bylaws to provide for a simple majority vote right for all shareholder voting matters; and shareholders have rejected the proposal calling for new policies with respect to board oversight of Aetna\'s political contributions.
After the meeting, any additional proxies received today will be counted together with any shares voted in person. Ms. Baker\'s final report will be included in the records of this meeting, and voting results will be included in the Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC. The business portion of this meeting is now adjourned. We will now take general questions.
John Lang
My name is John C. Lang, and I am here -- very pleased to be here, as the representative of the Aetna Retirees Association. My representation was passed by resolution by the board of the Aetna Retirees Association on March 11, 2013, and on April 9, 2013, such notification was filed with the office of the secretary. I would first like to bring the very warm regards of the Aetna Retirees Association to you, Mr. Chairman, to the Board of Directors, to the senior management group, which have assembled here, and to all the employees of Aetna that have done a truly outstanding job in what those of us, who was long-ago retired, still recognized as a very, very difficult environment in which to conduct health insurance business. You\'ve really done an outstanding job as your stock shows. I have 2 questions today in 3 types [ph] that the Board of Directors has asked me to bring to the meeting. First question, on April 2, 2013, the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services, part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services announced the growth rate for Medicare advantage of 3.3% for 2014 instead of the rate released last February of a decrease of 2.2%. Academic and industry research shows that care coordination and disease management in Medicare advantage plans result in higher quality care than fee-for-service, including lower hospital readmission rates and better outcomes for seniors with chronic conditions, so that a continuation of Medicare Advantage for 2014 and beyond is of vital concern to Aetna retirees. My first question is, will Medicare Advantage continue to be offered to Aetna retirees in future years?
Mark T. Bertolini
Yes.
John Lang
Does Aetna anticipate that better care and better outcomes under Medicare Advantage will offset the need to increase premiums and/or reduce benefits even if Medicare Advantage payments are reduced in future years to equalize them with fee-for-service Medicare costs?
Mark T. Bertolini
We -- as a company, Aetna remains committed to the Medicare Advantage program, and we\'ll continue to work on improving that cost structure for our members and to preserve member benefits while lowering costs. Our accountable care and provided collaboration efforts that were underway will also be critical part of that strategy to bridge the changes in Medicare Advantage funding over future years as we move to 100% of fee-for-service. And we believe that these strategies will also be an important part of how we solve the nation\'s health care cost problem and entitlement reform, improving the safety net over time for retirees.
John Lang
The second question is, as you know, and I\'m sure most people in this room know, many of the Aetna retirees have chosen to remain in the general region of Aetna, somewhere in Connecticut in New England, and there\'s a desire that has been expressed on it regarding future meetings. So the question specifically is, when can we expect Aetna to return to Hartford for the annual meeting, thus saving expenses and providing a greater opportunity for retiree and employee owners to participate?
Mark T. Bertolini
Well, as you know, Mr. Lang, we\'ve had the practice to moving our annual meetings around the places where a lot of our retirees live around the country. And we continue to look at bringing it back to Hartford. And I can tell you that before I leave, we\'ll have one in Hartford.
Mark T. Bertolini
Any other questions to come before this group? Yes, please. Please state your name and...
Unknown Shareholder
Dave Cacamus[ph]. I\'m a stockholder of Aetna, have been for several years. And I want to commend the Board and its employees for the excellent job they\'ve done in operating a wonderful company. This is the first time I\'ve had an opportunity to attend a stockholders meeting for Aetna. And I do not get a very welcome feeling. I look around and I see a lot of suits. And if I were to ask, how many people here are simple stockholders of Aetna. None? Except me. When I decided to come to this meeting, I read the rules and regulations. I came in and I was handed a sheet with the proper conduct at the meeting. This is my first one, so maybe I needed that. But I get the feeling that you\'re used to dealing with stockholders that are criminals, that have records, that are felons, that have done time in jail, that have a parole officer. I look at the security. I asked at the front desk where the meeting was, nobody knew. I finally did find out, and I was escorted down here by a gentleman in a suit with a earphone on. I didn\'t realize that I was such a risk to your people, and for that, I apologize. But I do not get the feeling that I was very welcome here, and that I am very welcome here. Thank you.
Mark T. Bertolini
Thank you for your insight. If you\'ve been at this meeting 2 years ago, you would have seen a very violent meeting where people bust into the room and they actually tried to knock me off the stage and protest over Aetna\'s rule on health care reform. So we\'ve had to increase our security for the last 3 years as a result of that incident. We do get threats often, and so we measure those. And hopefully, we\'ll return to a level of civility in the society, where we can hold annual meetings where people don\'t have to be threatened by virtue of just getting together. So unfortunately that is the circumstances we exist in today. And the reason you see all of the security and process in play. Any other questions? Okay. Thank you. We will adjourn the meeting, and thank you very much for your attendance and your support.
