Good morning. And welcome to the Aetna Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. As a remainder, this conference is being recorded.
For opening remarks and introductions, I\xe2\x80\x99ll now turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cowhey, please go ahead.
Tom Cowhey
Good morning. And thank you for joining Aetna\'s fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings call and webcast. This is Tom Cowhey, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna and with me this morning are Aetna\'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Bertolini; and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks, we will answer your questions. Karen Rohan, Aetna\'s President will join Mark and Shawn for the Q&A session.
During this call, we will make forward-looking statement. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning\'s press release and the reports we file with the SEC, including our 2013 Form 10-K, our 2014 Form 10-Qs and our 2014 Form 10-K when filed.
We have provided reconciliations of metrics related to the company\'s performance that are non-GAAP measures in our fourth quarter 2014 Financial Supplement and our updated 2014 Guidance Summary. Copies of which are available on the Investor Information section of aetna.com.
Finally, as you know, our ability to response to certain increase from investors and analyst in non-public forum is limited, so we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?
Mark Bertolini
Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we\xe2\x80\x99ve reported full year 2014 operating EPS of $6.70, representing a record results for the company, the high-end of our previous annual projection, year-over-year growth in excess of 7% and an operating EPS CAGR of 15% since 2010.
Looking back on 2014, we solved the price for nearly $1 billion of new fees and taxes, achieved pretax margins in excess of our initial 2014 projections, accelerated Coventry synergies, achieving a run rate in 2014 that will deliver at least $0.90 of operating EPS accretion in 2015, closing out our commitments to shareholders, enrolled nearly 600,000 public exchange members, while exceeding our initial profitability projections in this new program, bolstered our consumer platform through the acquisition of bSwift and continued to advance our efforts to shift the network model for patient-centric population health management.
Our 2014 results are a testament to the strength of our leadership team and the execution of our growth strategy. Underlying these full year results, we ended the year with more than 23.5 million medical members, well in excess of our previous projections and representing full year growth of approximately 1.4 million members.
We reported record operating revenue of nearly $58 billion, including organic growth of approximately 13% across multiple lines of business. We reported a full year Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio that absent our conservative stance on our ACA compliant block of business and higher than projected flu would have been at the low-end of our previous 2014 projections.
Our full year Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio of 80.2% was a very good result, as aggregate commercial medical cost trend increases remain moderate and our 51 to 300 employee block performed consistent with our previous projection.
Our operating expense ratio, excluding the impact of Healthcare Reform fees and taxes improved by 100 basis points, as we grew operating revenue and continued to focus on synergy realization.
Finally, we generated strong cash flow in 2014, which enabled us to continue to invest in our growth strategy, closed two acquisitions, pay down debt, increase our shareholder dividend and still repurchase $1.2 billion of our shares.
Our strong finish to 2014 in combination with our strong start to 2015 gives us the confidence this morning to increase our 2015 operating EPS projection to at least $7 per share. As always, this projection does not include any projection of prior year development and represents approximately 13% growth over 2014 results, when prior year development is excluded.
In a moment, Shawn, will discuss our 2014 results and 2015 guidance in greater detail, but first, I would like to discuss Aetna\'s growth strategy and how we are executing on that strategy.
At our Investor Conference in December we highlighted the multiple avenues we have to drive top and bottomline growth. Specifically, we discussed a stability of our large group commercial businesses and the ability of these businesses to continue to produce attractive returns and generate capital.
The growth of our Government franchise and the potential for sustained growth in the future, and the opportunity for additional growth in our individual business as exchanges continued to evolve.
Additionally, we discussed our continued efforts to health agenda transform the network model from one of episodic care to population health management and our strategy to lead the industry toward a more consumer-oriented marketplace.
I will now provide a brief update on how we are executing against some of these growth levers. Starting with our large group commercial business, 2014 was another solid year, as most of our large group commercial businesses met or exceeded our initial projections.
In particular our fee-based businesses had an outstanding year. We grew Commercial ASC membership by over 700,000 members for the year and exceeded our initial operating projection.
These results demonstrate the ability of our large group commercial businesses to continue to generate solid returns and to provide capital to reinvest for the benefit of our customers and shareholders.
Moving onto Government business, our Medicare franchise continues to be a key component of our strategy to grow our Government business and our 2014 results speak to our successes in this business.
During 2014, we grew our Medicare Advantage membership by almost 18% and our Medicare Supplement membership by nearly 20%, results were well in excess of our industry growth.
Additionally, we just completed another highly successful Medicare annual enrollment period, where growth exceeded our initial projections. We now project to grow our Medicare Advantage membership by 90,000 members in the first quarter, including double-digit percentage growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership.
A key driver of Aetna\'s Medicare Advantage membership growth trajectory has been our star ratings. For the second year in a row, approximately 80% of our sales have come through plans rated four stars or greater.
Continuing with Government, our Medicaid business has had an excellent year in 2014. Underlying the strong performance, we grew medical membership by over 100,000 members in 2014, including over 11,000 members related to our participation in multiple dual eligible demonstration projects. We grew premium revenue by over 60% and operating earnings exceeded our initial projections, driven by better underwriting margins in several of our key geographies and a strong prior year development.
Looking forward despite the previously disclosed exit from our Delaware Medicaid contract, we project 2015 to be another strong year of topline growth for our Medicaid franchise, driven primarily by growth from serving dual eligible and other high acuity populations.
Shifting to public exchanges, we are pleased with our first year execution, particularly in light of the well-publicized challenges with the initial launch of the public exchanges. We ended the year with approximately 560,000 on exchange members, modestly ahead of our most recent projections.
Additionally, while the open enrollment period is still ongoing, we are on track to exceed our initial enrollment projections for 2015. Further, we have successfully transitioned the vast majority of our Off Exchange membership to ACA compliant plans consistent with our previous projections.
As we look at our total individual business, we now project that we will end the first quarter with approximately 1.1 million members, including up to 800,000 on exchange members. We believe these strong results validate our strategy of focusing on geographies where we have a competitive cost structure and could provide the greatest value to potential customers.
As we enter the second year of this emerging marketplace, we are cautiously optimistic on the potential for public exchanges to develop into an attractive growth opportunity, where we continue to offer value to our customers and generate a reasonable return for our shareholders.
Let me now spend a few moments discussing our provider transformation efforts. We continue to advance our strategy of collaborating with providers to build a simpler, more integrated healthcare system. And we continue to make great strides as we signed contracts with 28 new ACO partners since year-end 2013, launched multiple new products backed by ACO contracts, doubled our membership covered by value-based contracts to more than 3 million members, and increased the percent of our medical costs that run through value-based contracts to 28% of total spend.
As we continue to focus incentives around improving the health of our members and lowering overall costs, we are moving closer to our healthcare system that rewards providers for keeping people healthy and ultimately more productive. Finally, in 2014, we continue to advance our strategy to become a more consumer-oriented company. For example, in the fourth quarter, we closed the bSwift acquisition.
This transaction was an important step forward as it accelerates our efforts to create the leading front-end by sharpened enroll capabilities necessary to drive the change to a more consumer-oriented marketplace. Additionally, bSwift adds backend eligibility and benefits of administration, an important element for our employer customers as they look to make the transition to divine contribution in private exchange models.
Combined with the other investments, we have been making including our efforts to transform the provider network models for our health insurance business, our investments in building a new modular administration platform and consumer facing tools like iTriage, we are not only preparing for the shift to define contribution in consumer-oriented models, we are positioning to drive it.
In summary, as we reflect on the many challenges that we face as a company and an industry last year, our 2014 results demonstrate strong financial fundamentals and execution against our growth strategies. As we begin 2015, I am confident in our strategic direction and the ability to execute the multiple growth opportunities ahead that Aetna is well-positioned to capitalize on and our updated 2015 operating EPS projection of at least $7 per share.
I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. By focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers and generating and deploying capital responsibly, we believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our fourth quarter and full-year results and our updated 2015 outlook. Shawn?
Shawn Guertin
Thank you Mark and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported full year 2014 operating earnings of $2.4 billion and operating earnings per share of $6.70, results at the high-end of our most recent projections and well in excess of our initial guidance for 2014. Aetna\'s operating results continue to be supported by strong operating fundamentals as evidenced by double-digit organic revenue growth, robust cash flow, healthy balance sheet metrics and achievement of target operating margins.
I\xe2\x80\x99ll begin with some comments on our overall full year 2014 performance. We grew medical membership by approximately 1.4 million members to more than 23.5 million members ending the year approximately 100,000 members higher than our previous projection as a result of stronger than projected December renewals, primarily in small group accounts.
We grew operating revenue by 23% to a record $58 billion driven by double-digit organic revenue growth across multiple lines of business and the full year impact of the Coventry acquisition. Our full-year Government medical benefit ratio was 84.9%, a very good result and a testament to the execution of our strategy to solve for the meaningful rate cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in 2014, combined with continued strong performance of our Medicaid business.
We improved our full year operating expense ratio by 100 basis points, excluding the impact of ACA related fees, driven by higher operating revenues and continued discipline in controlling costs. Finally, we generated over $1.5 billion in dividends from subsidiaries and returned an equal amount to shareholders in the form of shareholder dividends and share repurchases.
Looking more specifically at the fourth quarter results, we grew operating revenue by over 12% versus the same quarter last year to $14.8 billion driven primarily by membership growth in our Government and Commercial businesses. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses continue to perform quite well.
Our fourth quarter total medical benefit ratio was 83%, a good overall result and a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Our operating expense ratio increased from the same period last year to 19.7%. However, excluding ACA fees from our expenses, our operating expense ratio was essentially flat with the prior year quarter.
Our pretax operating margin was 5.5% for the quarter and 7.6% for the year consistent with our target operating margin range. This result represent Aetna\'s fifth consecutive year of achieving or exceeding this goal despite an increasing mix of Government and public exchange businesses and the many challenges that faced our industry in 2014.
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across our commercial, Medicaid and Medicare products, primarily attributable to third quarter 2014 dates of service.
Our reserve growth kept pace with premium growth and days claims payable were 49.2 days at the end of the quarter, down marginally from the third quarter, primarily as a result of processing improvements but up over four days year-over-year.
Turning to cash flow and capital, operating cash flows remain strong. Our full year Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.5 times of operating earnings. We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing approximately 3 million shares in the quarter for $243 million and distributing approximately $79 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend.
In summary, our fourth quarter results demonstrate the execution of Aetna\'s growth strategy, the success of the Coventry integration and the value of our diversified portfolio. I will now discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter performance in greater detail.
Beginning with our commercial business, our commercial membership declined by approximately 70,000 members during the quarter, driven by declines in our individual and small group insured books, partially offset by modest ASC membership growth. These results were consistent with our commitment to financially responsible pricing, where we favor margin over membership and price to projected underlying medical cost trends.
Our commercial medical benefit ratio was 82% for the quarter and 80.2% for the full year 2014, a good absolute result and consistent with our previous projections despite pressures from an early and more severe flu season. Importantly, the medical cost performance of our core commercial business and specifically, our 51 to 300 employee block, perform consistent with the projections we described on our third quarter 2014 earnings call.
Additionally, Aetna\'s commercial MBR was influenced by our continued prudent stance with regard to our ACA compliant blocks of business. Based on the most recent data available, we have adjusted our accruals related to the 3Rs during the fourth quarter. Specifically, we recorded $176 million of incremental reinsurance recoverable during the quarter, bringing our total for the year to $338 million.
We recorded additional net payables for the risk adjustors of $78 million, bringing the net full year total to $230 million. And we did not record any risk corridor receivables as of December 31, 2014. However in select geographies, we have recorded a modest risk quarter payable where our current projections indicate we will be required to contribute to this program.
Had we accrued a risk corridor receivable at December 31st, our full year 2014 commercial MBR would\'ve been lower by approximately 20 basis points. Consistent with our commercial MBR performance, Aetna\'s stand-alone 2014 commercial medical cost trend was in the middle to upper end of our originally projected range of 6% to 7%, in line with our previous projection.
Moving on from commercial, our Government franchise is another important growth lever for our business. As Mark mentioned earlier, our Government business had an outstanding year, from both a growth and profitability standpoint and now represents over 40% of our Health Care premiums.
Our Government business grew by 45,000 members in the quarter, primarily due to Medicaid growth of 26,000 members. Aetna\'s continued Government membership growth drove fourth quarter Government premiums to $5.4 billion, a 19% increase over the prior year period.
Our Government medical benefit ratio was 84.4% in the quarter, an excellent result in absolute terms and a 260 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Drivers of this year\xe2\x80\x99s excellent performance include favorable prior period reserve development, the success of actions designed to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap, including the health insurer fee, and continuing strong performance in our Medicaid business.
Finally, Group Insurance operating earnings were $21.3 million in the quarter, compared to $47.9 million in the same quarter of 2013, driven primarily by lower net investment income. For the full year 2014, Group Insurance operating earnings were $171 million, well in excess of 2013 results in our initial full year projections.
Turning to the balance sheet, our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At December 31, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 37%. Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with $100 million.
Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $169 million. We repurchased approximately 3 million shares for $243 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $79 million. After other sources, we ended the quarter with $100 million of cash at the parent, representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 349.8 million shares at December 31.
Moving on to 2015. This morning, we increased our 2015 outlook to at least $7 per share, up from our previous projection of at least $6.90 per share. As a reminder, Aetna\'s guidance does not include any projection of prior year development. This increased projection reflects the impact of our recently disclosed preferred drug contract for hepatitis C treatments on our commercial business, higher medical membership then we had previously projected, driven by our solid finish to 2014 and our encouraging early 2015 growth in both our public exchange and Medicare Advantage businesses.
These two favorable items are partially offset by a projected increase in flu and related costs in 2015, based on the severity of the current flu season. Our 2015 guidance is further influenced by the following drivers. We project that our first quarter medical membership will be approximately 23.5 million members, an increase of approximately 100,000 members versus our previous guidance.
Specifically, Aetna\'s commercial ASC membership is now projected to decline by approximately 175,000 members, a modest improvement versus our previous guidance. Commercial insured membership is now projected to be flat to slightly down as compared to year-end 2014, influenced by public and private exchange growth, offset by the previously discussed increase in small group renewal activity that occurred in late 2014 rather than in early 2015, and the potential for increased attrition in our smaller middle markets and off-exchange individual businesses.
Medicare membership is projected to grow by approximately 120,000 members, comprised of, at least 90,000 Medicare Advantage members and approximately 30,000 Medicare Supplement members, growth that is again higher than our previous projections. And Medicaid membership is now projected to be better than our previous forecast, with other growth almost entirely offsetting the exit from Delaware\'s Medicaid program.
We continue to project full year operating revenue to be at least $62 billion, as the impact of higher than projected membership growth on exchanges and individual Medicare Advantage is projected to be partially offset by the potential for increased attrition in our smaller middle-market and off-exchange individual businesses. We continue to project our full year total health medical benefit ratio to be 82% to 83%.
Aetna\'s 2015 core commercial medical cost trend is projected to be in the range of 6% to 7%, reflecting a projected increase in utilization of 50 to 100 basis points over 2014. We project our operating expense ratio will be approximately 18%. This metric is impacted by the increase in expense related to the ACA fees and taxes, which runs through the SG&A line, increasing the reported SG&A ratio for 2015 by approximately 140 basis points.
Our underlying operating expense ratio, excluding these fees and taxes, is projected to show improvement over our 2014 results. We project pretax operating margin to be at least 7.3%, consistent with our high single-digit target.
We project operating earnings to be over $2.4 billion. And finally, we project net dividends from subsidiaries to be approximately $1.8 billion as additional capital to support growth is held at the subsidiaries. We continue to project excess cash flow to the parent to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion, noting that increased premiums versus our initial projection could push us into the lower half of this range.
To the extent that current analyst consensus for 2015 contemplates the same quarterly earnings progression Aetna experienced in 2014, especially as it pertains to the first quarter, we would remind investors that the first quarter of 2014 was favorably impacted by severe winter weather and a lower than normal flu season, both of which we do not project to recur in 2015.
In closing, we are very pleased with the strength of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. I want to reiterate that our 2015 operating EPS projection of at least $7 as a floor and that we are committed to delivering results in excess of this early view. To that end, we remain focused on executing on our exchange strategy both public and private, delivering on our government growth strategy, improving the performance of our 51 to 300 employee commercial block of business and solving for the incremental ACA fees and taxes.
As we continue to execute during this challenging time for our industry, we are confident that we can achieve our 2015 projections and are well positioned to attain our 2018 goals of at least $80 billion in operating revenue and $10 in operating EPS.
I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?
Tom Cowhey
Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions. Operator, the first question please.
Operator
Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Josh Raskin
Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess question for some of the comments that Mark had made around the value-based reimbursement and you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some announcements from the government. I guess I am just curious from your perspective what do you think the government is trying to accomplish? And then how do you think that impacts Aetna\'s ability to sort of differentiate delivery systems relative to whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a fee-for-service world on the government side or even other payers that are going to start sort of accelerating that change?
Mark Bertolini
Thanks, Josh. I think probably the most important part of what the government is trying to do is to partner with private sector to get more value-based contracting underway. And so, I actually welcome the opportunity to work with the government, because as you know Medicare and Medicaid can comprise up to 60% of a hospital\xe2\x80\x99s revenue.
And as a result, unless we have impact with the government as a partner, unless we can\xe2\x80\x99t move value-based contracting along and get the kind of behavior change that we need to get as a result from health systems themselves. So we view this as positive. We are not quite sure on the details yet. We will probably likely to go faster and bigger, but I think we have more a longer road to hold before we get to a conclusion that we are completely comfortable with where they are headed. But so far, so good and we welcome the opportunity.
Josh Raskin
And I guess just to follow up on a pragmatic view of Medicare Advantage, does this help expand networks to make MA more attractive in light of the fact that providers may be you know looking at some of those same types of arrangements, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s with the government or with the health plan?
Mark Bertolini
I think, actually Josh, the genesis of our whole Healthagen program was built off of early positive results by us partnering with health systems on Medicare Advantage by sharing with them the risk-adjusted revenue through capitation to those health systems.
So I think the most important part of value-based insurance is changing the hospital, the health system model from one of revenue generation to one of margin generation, and you can only do that by passing some of that risk and helping those health systems manage their risk. So I think for us 6, 7 years ago this ability to pass across risk adjusted revenue to health systems was, hah, moment for us in building the Healthagen enterprise.
Josh Raskin
Okay. Perfect. Thanks.
Operator
We will go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.
Peter Costa
Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the decision to not book receivable for the risk quarter payment relative to what you did in the third quarter where I think there was an offsetting receivable relative to the adjuster?
Shawn Guertin
Yes, Peter. That is correct. We did have that contemplated when we closed the third quarter. The decision to not do that, probably strained our numbers by about a dime this quarter, but obviously the performance of the core business was strong enough that we can overcome that. This really is a question about sort of certainty at this point and make no mistake we believe the loss certainly says we are out the money. We believe it\'s an important part of the early stages of this program. But some of the activity around the budget process and some of the guidance that came out frankly created a degree of uncertainty about the collectibility and we just didn\'t feel like we were over the threshold to do that.
In addition, I mean the risk -- on this whole topic, it is really important for everyone to realize what I would call the relative immaturity of the data that pertains to both the base estimates of claim experience, which is still emerging in this new program, but also the data we are using to estimate risk adjustors is, as you know, from an outside consulting source of gathering industry data. It is certainly not the official data set upon which we will ultimately make that calculation. And so, there still is a lot of uncertainty. So I think when you put all those things together, it led to our decision.
Peter Costa
This is a follow-up. So do you expect to adjust those sometime in the first quarter or not till really the second quarter when you get the final numbers from the government?
Shawn Guertin
It will depend on what comes out of this emerging dataset. So I would say conceptually, we would directionally adjust those numbers as the data matures. But to your point, the real sort of final adjustment and the real meaningful adjustments I think will be in the middle to second half of next year when we actually get quote the real data.
Peter Costa
Thank you very much.
Operator
Next, Ana Gupte with Leerink.
Ana Gupte
Thank you. Good morning. On the initial cost trends of 6%, 7%, you had a huge increase baked in because of hepatitis C and then just overall from pharmacy. Now that you have negotiated this contract with Gilead, do you feel there is any upside or is that contributed to even higher going forward in \'15?
Shawn Guertin
Part of one of the reasons that we increased our overall guidance outlook for 2015 is I do think that our final negotiations on this topic are creating upside. And I think sort of within the range it clearly will be a positive for us. We\'ve held the overall range at this point. It is still early, but directionally it certainly would -- is a positive factor for us, both from an earnings standpoint and a medical cost trend standpoint.
Ana Gupte
And then, Shawn, you talked about the 49.2 on trends, it\xe2\x80\x99s not only four days higher than last year, but that is historical high from the recent perspective? Any reason to keep it that high into \'16 now that the raw materials have been implemented, do you have much better understanding of exchanges you saw?
Shawn Guertin
A couple things. I would like to continue to think on exchanges that we have tried to continue to be prudent in our reserve setting. We also have a lot of early growth in our Medicaid high acuity programs with the duals, where we are trying to position that appropriately.
I would also say that just on directionally the days claims payable in our government business is a little bit longer than our commercial business. And so some of this is just the mathematics as more of that is mixing in and more of our growth is coming for there.
So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s really a combination of -- there still is some uncertainty on the new programs, and we have tried to be prudent there, but some of it is just the changing mix of our business.
Ana Gupte
Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator
We\xe2\x80\x99ll go next to Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.
Andy Schenker
Good morning. So maybe just to start, if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the moving parts in the commercial risk business, I know you touched on earlier, but clearly better public exchange. Enrollment being offset by a little bit more losses and some of the group business. But maybe you could just give us a little bit more details on the moving parts since the Analyst Day, thanks?
Mark Bertolini
Andy, I think you might be talk -- sounds like you are talking about volume. So let me talk about couple of things that played out. The biggest thing is around small group. And the most important thing there is in small group 12/1, December 1st has become because of keep what you have sort of the new 1/1 in this business. So there is a good chunk of renewal activity that is now taking place in December. And at the end of the day, we did better in renewing that block of business than we had initially projected.
And so in many ways, if you think about business that used to be 1/1 is effectively 12/1 now, we are getting some of that growth earlier in the cycle than maybe we would\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the past. On individual, we continue to feel good about it. We expect net will probably grow in the first quarter from about a million members both on and off exchange at the end of the year to about 1.1 million members at the end of the third quarter with probably up to 800,000 of that being on exchange membership.
Andy Schenker
Okay. Great. And just real quick following up on the three Rs. So I appreciate the reversal in the risk quarters here. But also on the risk adjusted, it sounds like you are booking additional payables here. So the interpretation here to be that their membership may have actually turned out to be a little bit more profitable than you expected. And maybe how does that influence how you ended \'14 about your expectations for \'15 with the new calculation? Thank you.
Mark Bertolini
Yeah. I don\'t know that I\xe2\x80\x99d go there quite yet to say that it\'s going to be more profitable and it\'s really not due to anything other than what I was talking about before, which is just the degree of estimation we are having to deal with all of the data sort of the emergency -- the emerging claim experience, as well as the risk adjusted payable.
So again we\'ve continued to look at that data and make our best estimate off of that. We continue to feel good about this business going forward and would expect this business to be modestly profitable in 2015.
Operator
We\xe2\x80\x99ll take our next question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Borsch
Yes, hi. Good morning. I realize it\xe2\x80\x99s early to talk about 2016, but I am -- what I want to ask about is your early conversations with large employers about next year, which I\'m sure are already underway. And where you have three-year type contracts, how much is the Cadillac tax coming into the range of discussion given the three-year window from 2016 will bracket that? And then what changes do you see employers contemplating and where do private exchanges come into that mix?
Mark Bertolini
Hey, Matt, I\xe2\x80\x99ll start with the latter part of your question first, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn over to Karen to talk a bit about what we are seeing in the conversation with large employers. I think we\'ve already seen the impact of the Cadillac tax on certain large accounts, particularly those that are in the midst of negotiating five-year labor agreements.
So I thing the Cadillac tax is already playing a role. Our three-year agreements with employers, I don\'t know that that will have an impact right away, unless there is a union contract as part of it. But we are already seeing it on the union side, not quite on the large employer side.
So I think the real question is whether or not, we have private exchange models that are stable. And I think this year we saw less enrollment in private exchanges on the part of large employers than we had anticipated and that rippled through our own private exchange membership as we participate in some of those. Or maybe Karen you could talk a bit about what we are seeing for the large employer season.
Karen Rohan
Hi, Matt. It is really early for 2016. However, we are starting to have those conversations with our national account members. We have actually seen increase in our pipeline even earlier this year than we did last year, and it looks somewhat stronger than it did last year as well. So we are quite pleased with the conversations that we are having, and the pipeline that we see for \'16, but again it really is early.
Matthew Borsch
And so the pipeline overall as it relates to the enrollment growth potentially for next year, but what about on the private exchange side, do you see any signs building that will see an acceleration going into next year on that front?
Karen Rohan
We continue to have conversation around private exchange with a lot of interest in discussion on the private exchange both in the national accounts and in middle market. So we continued the dialogue and we have continued to see that interest.
Matthew Borsch
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
We\'ll take our next question from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.
Justin Lake
Thanks. Good morning. First question is just around the re-pricing of the middle market business that you talked about in the third quarter. Can you give us an update in terms of what you are seeing on membership retention and target yields in terms of achieving them?
Karen Rohan
Yeah. I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to. It\xe2\x80\x99s Karen. Relative to the 51 to 300 block, what you are referring to, as we talked about in December, that block was not performing relative to our expectations, so we took pricing actions.
As a result, we continue to monitor those pricing actions. We are seeing what we would have expected relative to membership and one other things that you know, we monitor is the business that stays with us versus the business that leaves us.
We are pleased with what we are seeing that we are keeping the business that we want to keep the business that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to keep we are shedding and it is in line with expectations. However, I would comment, again, that continues to be early in the cycle. But so far the performance is in line with where we would have expected it to be.
Justin Lake
Got it. And then just the question on the pharmacy side, I know there were some network issues with CMS? Can you give us an update in terms of what happened there? What you are doing to fix it? And then in terms of, should we read this toward any kind of issues with the -- was it a function of the PBM outsourcing relationship you have there or was it more internal to Aetna? And then just any view on any potential sanctions or issues from a CMS perspective, we should think about?
Mark Bertolini
Hey, Justin. I always start with the sanctions we have received to Corrective Action Plan request and we expect that to have marginal impact on our star ratings overall. So we believe that we have this under control.
We have been in constant contact with CMS. This is a little bit the trouble with some innovation. We innovated with narrower networks to provide better pricing for enrollees and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some pushback from the pharmacy side, particularly independent pharmacists in talking to those enrollees, which created noise in the system.
We have reached out. We have solved a lot of these issues so far. We are making sure that the beneficiaries are not at harm from any standpoint in getting their drugs or their treatment is necessary. We are on the phone with CMS everyday on this issue and we believe that we have a plan to fix this. The impact financially to us as an organization in the near-term is manageable, very manageable.
Justin Lake
And just the PBM impact in terms of CVS, is there any read through we should have in terms of this is part of the complexity or non you said it was just your narrow network?
Mark Bertolini
It was just us. It was product innovation, putting a different kind of product in the marketplace. We communicated it pretty thoroughly. We\xe2\x80\x99ve reviewed it with CMS before we did it. It was all approved. But we got pushback from the marketplace. And as we know and as we are very carefully to know, all the time we do not want to put the beneficiaries at risk, and so we move down a very quickly. We were the ones who found it, reported it and got engaged.
Justin Lake
Got it. Thanks a lot.
Operator
We\xe2\x80\x99ll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen.
Christine Arnold
Good morning. Could you speak to your expectations for the duals in terms of profitability and also your Medicare Advantage book? How are you thinking about profitability of that in 2015?
Mark Bertolini
I\xe2\x80\x99ll start with Medicare Advantage book. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pass it over to Shawn for the duals. On the Medicare Advantage, we saw 80% of our growth so far and for this year in four plus star plan, so that always bodes well from a revenue standpoint and MBR standpoint. Those are plans that generally we have good results with.
So our expectation is that we\xe2\x80\x99ll move margin up again for Medicare this year. That is our goal and part of our objectives. So we are happy with our Medicare performance -- Medicare Advantage performance and look forward to another strong year from that organization.
Shawn Guertin
Yeah. And to wrap that going back on Investor Day, we did talk about our Government MBR being essentially flat ex-PYD. But inside that we are expecting to see the Medicare business improve and the Medicaid revert a little bit to more normal levels after a very strong year.
On the duals, given that it\'s still in the very early stages of maturity on these programs, they will certainly generate a lot more revenue in 2015. And I -- the marginal, the profit of these early on will be relatively low if any in the early stages of these programs. So it\'s not a big profit contributor per say. We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly not seeing anything now in the early stages of these contracts that would make us feel any differently than that at this stage.
Christine Arnold
Great. Thanks.
Operator
We\xe2\x80\x99ll go next to Dave Windley with Jefferies.
Dave Windley
Hi. Follow-up there on the Medicare Advantage, you mentioned a couple of times that 80% of your growth is coming in your four star plans. I believe that kind of an 80% mix of membership in four star plans is your starting point. Also, are you surprised that you\'re not seeing, say disproportionate growth into your higher star plans?
Mark Bertolini
Not really. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s early. And I think it all depends on the pricing in the market relative to the marketplace. So at zero premium markets where all prices are pretty equal, I think star ratings matter.
In other markets, we\xe2\x80\x99re all over the competitive map relative to our competitors and so I wouldn\'t necessarily jump to that conclusion. I think, we like the fact that 80% of our membership -- new memberships coming from those plans.
It is the right kind of footprint for us. We\xe2\x80\x99re not done yet with our star ratings and moving those up. Our goal is 100%. And so I think that is, we will continue to build on that. But we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased. We\xe2\x80\x99re not at all worried.
Dave Windley
If I could ask a similar question but in the individual market, I think, you talked about bringing lots of new product to market through your ACO relationships. Could you talk about how that is influencing your membership gains in the -- on exchange market?
Karen Rohan
Hi. It\xe2\x80\x99s Karen. Relative to the on-exchange market, as you know, we extended our footprint this year to add an additional market. We have put competitive products into the marketplace on the exchanges. As you might recall, our strategy was to go into markets where we had a competitive cost position, where we were comfortable with the regulatory environment and where we could have our return on capital. You can see from the results that we are expecting about 800,000 members at the end of the first quarter and that is in line with our expectations and we\xe2\x80\x99re quite pleased with the results to date on exchange.
Dave Windley
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
We\xe2\x80\x99ll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.
A.J. Rice
Hi, everybody. I might go back to asking about the days claims payable. I know you had that in remarks, 42.9. It\xe2\x80\x99s up four days year-to-year. Would you characterize that as a change that\xe2\x80\x99s related to the mix of business change, or would you say the balance sheet more conservatively positioned as you exit this year than last year and is there a target for that?
Mark Bertolini
I would say that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go as far as sort of forming that conclusion that we\xe2\x80\x99re necessarily more conservative. We had a very strong year, last year on prior year development. It could certainly turn out that way as you all know. But, again, this is really driven I think by two factors. Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s the growth in the Government business and that\'s just a structural factor to the point of your question that\'s going to push on that number as that business grows.
But as these new programs grow like exchanges for example, like the new dual contracts for example. We certainly are trying not to get ahead of ourselves on the reserve side. And again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the uncertainties. And if it turns out that and that we\'ve been overly cautious then we may get a result more akin to what you\'re asking about. But at this point, I wouldn\'t go that far. And I would say there are elements of sort of both structural change and caution regarding growth populations in that number today.
A.J. Rice
Okay. And if maybe I can slip in on the area of co-ops that\xe2\x80\x99s been in the news and particularly one co-op liquidating in Iowa, Nebraska where you guys have a presence. Can you give us a little flavor for how that changes the dynamic? Does that end up being a positive for you, or is it something that if you caution and what do you see in generally around co-op activity in your exchange markets?
Mark Bertolini
I will trust Karen. I just want to make one comment on the co-ops. We believe that the recent failure of Iowa, Nebraska is a president kind of transactions. So the way we handle this was very much aim toward is probably is not the first, although not the last of these co-ops to have issues. And we want to make sure that first and foremost customers are not left out and lurch on this. But secondly, that we obviously have the right kind of products in the marketplace. So, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn that over to Karen to talk a little bit about how we handle this specific situation.
Karen Rohan
Yeah. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been working very closely with the state because as Mark said, we want to ensure the access to care by those members. Essentially, the state has encouraged those members to go into the open-market and that\xe2\x80\x99s essentially what\xe2\x80\x99s happening and we are pricing those members in accordance with the prices that we have put in the marketplace. So, we are managing those individuals as we would normally manage the enrollment process. So, we expect to see an increase in overall membership but at the price appropriately.
A.J. Rice
Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator
We\xe2\x80\x99ll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe
Thanks. Good morning. Debt-to-cap came up a little bit 37%, I think from under 35%. I guess how quickly do you want to get that back down? And then if a deal presented, where is your tolerance on sort of the high-end that where you\xe2\x80\x99d take debt to cap? Thanks.
Mark Bertolini
Our commitment now is to return that debt-to-cap to 35% by the end of 2015, so that\'s what will be marching towards. I don\xe2\x80\x99t really want to speculate on sort of a hypothetical debt-to-cap on a hypothetical deal. Obviously, we look at every deal on the strategic merits and the financial merits of the deal and it is all part of that equation when we make those decisions.
Ralph Giacobbe
Okay. And if I could squeeze one another one in. You had pulled forward some Coventry synergies I think last year. I guess, can you help us, what did you capture and what sort of the incremental opportunities we think about in 2015 and maybe what\xe2\x80\x99s baked into assumptions? Thanks.
Shawn Guertin
Yeah. We -- I think the last time we\xe2\x80\x99ve updated you, I think we said something in the order of $0.60 was we achieved or at least that. And as Mark mentioned, we are confident that the run rate with which we are exiting the year is at least $0.90. It is in fairness getting more difficult as the organization has become more integrated, to sort of tease out that\xe2\x80\x99s a synergy versus that\xe2\x80\x99s a productivity improvement, which we\xe2\x80\x99re working on all the time anyway. So, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that we will achieve at least the $0.90 that we had committed to you when we announced the deal.
Ralph Giacobbe
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Okay. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go next to Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.
Scott Fidel
Thanks. First question, just -- if you can give us an update on how performance has been tracking in international and student ever since you put in collective pricing a couple quarters ago? And then just more broadly. Mark, just interested if, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve been down in Washington, if you are seeing any signs at this point of any type of viable contingency strategy being developed here in terms of, if SCOTUS does hand out an adverse ruling on the subsidies?
Mark Bertolini
Sure. Scott, I\xe2\x80\x99ll handle both of those. International is performing ahead of expectations based on the changes we\xe2\x80\x99ve made in the third quarter and student health is performing at expectations.
So when you combine that with the 51 to 30, actually the Commercial MBR is performing better, offset by the impact of flu in the fourth quarter and the change we made regarding risk adjusters. So I think that\'s how we look at the overall bridge to the MBR in the fourth quarter and for the full year.
As it relates to the conversation of Washington, I\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been engaged there on a number of points. And I think, there is a realization that throwing pick your number, 10 million people into the uninsured marketplace as a result of decision by the Supreme Court would not be a wise thing for anybody.
And so I think there is a lot of conversation going on and what kind of continuance we would need, if I need to get through the end of the year, what kind of solutions would be offered by both sides to get to a place, where the program would just not abandon people. And I think that conversations are ongoing. I think it is actually constructive at this point in time. And I think there are people on both sides of the aisle who want to try and make something work should that decision come forward.
Scott Fidel
Okay. Thanks. Do you think just on -- this has been driven sort of equally on the administration and congressional side or is it more biased towards one or the other at this point?
Mark Bertolini
It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say. I\xe2\x80\x99m not involved in all the conversations. So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that there is probably a lot going on around this issue.
Scott Fidel
Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Okay. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck
Great. Thanks. In the earnings release, there\'s a lot of talk about investments in the G&A line to fund growth initiatives, but I guess there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of commentary on the call about it. Can you talk a little bit about what you were spending the money on and how we should think about those investments spend to meet the leverage on that next year or is this a continued level of spending?
Mark Bertolini
Kevin, I think from an overall standpoint, I think our biggest investments are in health agenda continue to hold provider development and the ACO process. And so that organization gets a fair amount of capital. I think on the other though is preparing for the consumer marketplace particular the bSwift acquisition is one. There are some things we\xe2\x80\x99ll need to do to make that platforms more robust.
There\'s also a lot of work going on. A new consumer platform is very low cost and is modular. And all of that is aimed at connecting those two at some point in the future, where we have this consumer platform and exchange and benefit administration platform connected to ACOs and markets, that we think is disruptive in a lot of ways to the current models that we see in our marketplace.
So that\xe2\x80\x99s where the lion share of the investments going. However, we continue to invest in Medicare on stars and on solving the funding gap. Medicaid and expansion in the market particular dual eligibles and in the commercial business it\xe2\x80\x99s largely toward how do we streamline our operating costs and make that a better generator of capital for the kind of investments, we want to make for the future in the other items I just mentioned.
Kevin Fischbeck
Okay. Great. And then I just want to clarify something on the trend guided. I think you guys reaffirmed trend to 6 to 7 but I thought at the Investor Day, you kind of sit on an apples-to-apples basis that would\'ve been 5 to 5.5. But I think in the comment you said it was a 50 to 100 basis point increase off of where you were. And I think I was expecting at 125 last time. So is there a change there, did the 2014 base, change and that\xe2\x80\x99s the Delta or is there something else going on there?
Mark Bertolini
No. We just -- you\'re right. Your numbers are right, 5 to 5.5 and originally we had talked about an assumption of 50 to 100 basis points of utilization increased. But we had also talked about an additional 50 basis points of unit cost most of which was Hep C that got us into the 6 to 7 range. As I mentioned earlier, that Hep C number should be better now and as a result of the negotiations we\'ve concluded. And so, clearly as a positive factor inside the range of 6 to 7, but for the timing being, we held to 6 to 7 range.
Kevin Fischbeck
Okay. That\xe2\x80\x99 s right in there. All right. Great. Thanks.
Operator
We\xe2\x80\x99ll go next to Tom Carroll with Stifel.
Tom Carroll
Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Shawn, just a quick clarification on your 2015 quarterly comments, are you suggesting first quarter \xe2\x80\x9815 will be a flat down or slightly up from first quarter \xe2\x80\x9814 given the items you mentioned?
Shawn Guertin
Well, if I hold all other things being equal, it\'s down right because what I\'m talking about is the absence of a better event typical flu season on the absence of some of the temporary benefit, we got because of some of the severe weather. So I just would ask that again when we look at the pattern that\'s out there, and we think about the pattern projecting it. That first quarter pattern, we should not assume at least if those items recur.
Tom Carroll
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
We\xe2\x80\x99ll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush.
Sarah James
Thank you. Just a follow-up on that CapEx, could you provide a little bit more detail on seasonality, so it sounds like we have certain items that would be beneficial to the first half. As far as the earnings mix like high deductible plans and exchange is growing which is the backend cost items as well as the non-repetitive start-up cost with that balances against the flu and weather impact and improvement in dual. So how do you see the mix of first half versus second half finding up against \xe2\x80\x9814?
Shawn Guertin
Again I think that, again with the absence of those factors, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it to be as steep. I would say that when we look at the projections a little bit more than half of the earnings or in the first half of the year as they typically are. So if anything it\'s just a bit flatter and a bit more equal between the two halves of the year than maybe we saw a year ago. Again this will all turn hang on, how does the flu season play out, a few deep play out and things like that. But as we said right here, I would standby what I just said.
Sarah James
Okay. And can you tell us what the different between the below average flu year is versus an above average flu year?
Shawn Guertin
This year is looking -- in our guidance, we\'ve assume at this point that we get strained by about $0.05 by the play out of the flu season. We probably had something around $0.05 in the fourth quarter as well. So that, the two of those together would give you a sense of what this is looking like as we play it out?
Mark Bertolini
The flu season looks a lot like 2012, 2013, if you look at the charts, they are almost identical.
Sarah James
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
We will take our last question from Michael Baker with Raymond James.
Michael Baker
Yeah. Thanks a lot. Mark, I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how you planned the position bSwift relative to the consult multi-carrier offering? And then if you could secondarily give us a sense for which employer segment you expect to see the greatest initial uptick, now that its can be push forward by Aetna?
Mark Bertolini
Well, I think, obviously, how we play it will depend by segment. I think in the large employer, the National Accounts segment we will need some participation from multiple carriers, which we are already engaged in conversions around.
I think from the middle market standpoint it can be total replacement and we view that as an opportunity to move people first to notional defined contribution, so they can fund it in a way and create a marketplace for their employees. And then ultimately to true defined contribution, which we think is an opportunity at the high-end of the middle market at the low-end of the middle market, obviously, be insured.
On the individual side, obviously, it\xe2\x80\x99s the public exchanges. But we see a lot opportunity in the public exchange marketplace, particularly as we work through all the issues with the Federal Government, where private exchange models that connect Medicare, Medicaid, Individual and Small Group, any marketplace, and create ubiquity or fundageability of products through one marketplace and opportunity for private exchanges, including the potential for subsidy in the longer run. So that all depends on how things work out in Washington.
But we see this private exchange model even more importantly with the ben/admin platform on the backend, which most private exchange models do not have and that ability to provide benefit administration for the employer bundled into the cost of the overall product and the private exchange experience, our marketplace, really creates a lot of flexibility with us to provide value to certain employers segments.
Michael Baker
And then just one follow-up, in terms of the large end, is the initial drive to make it risk based or an initial stages be more flexible to the particular customer needs?
Mark Bertolini
We will be flexible but we will offer both alternatives.
Michael Baker
Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
Mark Bertolini
Yeah.
Tom Cowhey
