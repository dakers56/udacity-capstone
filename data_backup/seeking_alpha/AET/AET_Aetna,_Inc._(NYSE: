Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the first day of Morgan Stanley\'s Global Healthcare Conference. I\'m Andy Schenker. I\'m Morgan Stanley\'s managed care facility analyst. I\'m pleased to have with me this morning, Shawn Guertin, Aetna\'s Chief Financial Officer. Thanks for being here, Shawn.
Shawn M. Guertin
Thank you.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Before we get started, I do need to read a brief disclosure statement. Please note that all important disclosures including personal holding disclosures and Morgan Stanley disclosures appear on the Morgan Stanley public website and morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures. Also we\'re going to try to keep this as interactive as possible, so if anyone has a question at any time, raise your hand and someone will come over with a microphone.
Maybe with that, let\'s just start. Shawn, if you can maybe give us just a brief summary of Aetna and how it\'s positioned for the changing healthcare environment.
Shawn M. Guertin
Great. Like you I also have been handed something that I need to read. So let me take care of \xe2\x80\x93 dispense for that. During the session, we will make forward-looking statements including concerning our 2013 performance, risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in Aetna\'s 2012 Form 10-K, in second quarter 2013 10-Q and the 8-K that we filed this morning.
So just a couple of areas to comment on to get us started off the top. The first is just to remind some of you and layout sort of in terms of how we think about the future, sort of what really is our growth story? And there\'s really six key points to this growth story. Two of them are foundational points that sort of underlie the business themselves. And one is our belief that a diversified portfolio of businesses is the best path to producing predictable earnings growth over time and we feel that our Accountable Care initiative is gaining traction and ultimately we\'ll be the network model of the future. And that also will enable all the businesses.
The other four points of this are business specific. One, that we believe we can profitably grow our large group franchise which is substantial, that our government franchise which is a bigger franchise now post Coventry will be a growth engine for the company in the coming years. Individual and small group business even post Coventry make up a very modest portion of our overall earnings, so we are not overexposed there and to some degree could present optionality for the future. And the last is that the Coventry acquisition is strategically and financially attractive.
When you look at our first half 2013 performance, on the positive side the story really was the commercial business and that was really a function of the medical cost trend environment being fairly stable and benign during the first half of the year, so commercial was the real story. We did get some positive performance in the second quarter out of Medicaid, so that also was encouraging. The positive results in the first half of the year were pressured by two specific areas in our Medicare business which we discussed on the call, and as you saw in our reported results there were also pressured year-over-year by our Group Insurance business and in particular our Group Life business.
As we look at the quarter-to-date results that we\'ve seen so far, those patterns are largely the patterns that directionally we see playing out; still obviously a bit early to conclude anything but directionally what\'s been going on in the business appears to be continuing so far to-date, commercial continuing to be a very positive performer and the pressure spots on Medicare and on the Group Life business also sort of continuing along, so no new directions coming out of the first half.
And then the last thing I\'ll comment on is just Coventry. We\'re in the early stages of the integration. As most of you know we closed in May. The business is performing very well. I\'ve been very pleased with the talent that we\'ve been able to retain. Coventry had some very strong talents in the local markets and we\'ve been able to retain a lot of that talent and that\'s a real positive.
As we mentioned on the call we expect now to be at the high end of our accretion range for this year of $0.20 to $0.25 and we\'re growing increasingly confident in our estimates for \'14 and \'15 of $0.45 and $0.90, respectively, that we\'ll be able to deliver on that. So, so far so good on the Coventry side.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
So maybe building on that, on the accretion potential from Coventry, what do you think are the opportunities to maybe even surpass that. I understand I guess it\'s still early in the integration but maybe what are some of the levers where you could actually beat those [ph]?
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes, it\'s a little bit difficult to speculate because it\'s always a function of the underlying performance of the business going into \'14 but really probably the most actionable one is one that we\'re pressing on every day which is the pace at which we are able to extract these. And we\'ve set sort of aggressive targets for our organization both in terms of magnitude and timing and we continue to press those as quickly as we can.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Okay. Maybe switching gears a little bit here. You initially planned to offer 14 for upcoming exchange. You\'ve obviously pulled out of a few. Coventry adds a few others in there. If you could just discuss with us your exchange strategy and how you originally positioned your [indiscernible]?
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes, so the 14 states that we\'ve talked about on an Aetna stand-alone basis as you mentioned, as you\'ve seen, some of you seen in the press and we\'ve talked about, we have exited some of those 14 states. The primary reason we would execute or exit those states is really twofold. We said since day one that we were going to earn our fair return or at least our expected fair return based on our pricing today. And I don\'t anticipate that we would go into a market with anything less than that, especially a new and sort of untested market. So great adequacy is one of the things that we\'ve really been focused on.
And then the second is the strength of your underlying cost structure, mainly your provider network and how confident you are in driving cost structure in the market, the ability to sort of managed care, those are really the two levers. So as you mentioned, 14 goes down with the exits and we\'re now sort of adding some of the Coventry states where we didn\'t overlap back. So the number will be higher than where we are now as we complete that process with Coventry.
The one comment I want to make on this because counting states has been a simple way to talk about this, but it also could be a bit misleading. You can participate in specific rating regions in a state and for example you may do that just to cover a metro area that might be across the state border. You might really be participating in one MSA in a state, so just keep that in mind as you see these things shake out sort of state counting is a bit simplistic.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Obviously still early and you\'re still just feeling out your 14 positions, I mean how do you guys think about the optionality of exchanges and small group and individual maybe longer term?
Shawn M. Guertin
Yeah, I think it will be a good business and I think it will be a business with strong local health plans that we should be in. I\'m under no illusion that it\'s going to be a high margin business, but I think we will be able to earn a fair margin. Really there\'s a lot of different forces whether it\'s consumerism or the cost of healthcare that I think are going to make this a place that more and more people will go to get their healthcare. My only concern all along is getting from A to B, right? There inevitably will be operational bumps in the road as these things get off the ground but they will be worked through and I think that\'s really \xe2\x80\x93 the only question is, is when do we get there.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Okay. So your positioning in 14 does not necessarily indicate where you guys are going to be maybe by \'16?
Shawn M. Guertin
No, our positioning of 14 I think the word I\'ve used consistently is we want a prudence exposure to this market. We have to learn, we have to get our feet wet, we have to sort of have some live fire, if you will, around this. And I don\'t think prudent means playing it none. I think you have to have sort of a good balance of that but you certainly have to recognize the risk you\'re going into and we\'re going to take a very measured step in that regard.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Okay, that\'s great. You\'ve kind of related the public changes you guys have mentioned you\'re participating a lot and private exchange as well offering. Maybe if you could just discuss how you guys approach to those opportunities?
Shawn M. Guertin
Right. So I think this one may be a bit slower in taking shape but certainly there was some media coverage over the weekend on retiree exchanges, so you can see there is some traction with employers out there about considering this as an alternative distribution system. We play in something on the order of 10, I think, plus or minus private exchanges today. And as you alluded to, we are in the process of working on our own proprietary private exchange.
I think many of the dynamics strategically around exchanges for private and public are the same and that is you\'re going to have to have an effective price point which means an effective cost structure. A lot of that comes out of our Accountable Care and provider collaboration initiatives going forward. So this is going to continue to keep the pressure on sort of delivering favorable cost structure there. I think there is both opportunity and risks here, right? Certainly the opportunity in some of these exchanges to convert a self insured life back to a fully insured life and the profit dynamics per member being 4x or 5x insured to the self funded, that\'s a very attractive opportunity where simplistically you could lose membership but actually gain profitability if you got it in the right proportion.
So it is an important trend to watch out for. The proprietary exchange is really premised on a couple of different notions that that might be a more effective model to improve the overall quality of care and then the overall well being of the individuals as well as maybe giving us a bit more flexibility and maybe tailoring a network or a benefit designed for a specific industry vertical as an example. So again, we\'re playing on both sides but I do think this will be an important trend over the coming years.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
I mean you kind of touched on this in the beginning, it does get a lot of media attention, but I mean what is your thoughts on the ramp-up on that? Do you think it\'s going to be a slower process just by maybe some of the headlines around it?
Shawn M. Guertin
Yeah, I always say that we\'ve been very good in this industry about identifying the trends and we\'ve been reasonably bad at estimating the speed at which they happen. For example, people have been predicting the death of the TPA market for as long as I\'ve actually been in this business and it still exists out there. So I think it\'s more of that. I think it is a trend and it will sort of slowly be \xe2\x80\x93 it will be watched by other people. And if it\'s successful, then others will join in and certainly somebody who\'s very big and visible and respected like I\'ve been, that will get a lot of attention if that turns out to be a successful decision and it\'s well executed.
So again, I think it is a long-term trend in the commercial space and so you have to figure out how you\'re going to win in that environment. But I don\'t think it\'s going to be this sort of revolutionary change, it certainly could be, but that doesn\'t appear to be \xe2\x80\x93 there\'s a lot more people talking about this than they\'re actually doing it. That\'s probably the one liner that I would say on this.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Okay, and it\'s helpful. Just as a reminder, if anyone has a question anytime, feel free to raise your hand and we will get you a microphone. But moving on, think about Medicare Advantage you mentioned the retirees, I mean obviously historically you\'ve played more in the group side, Coventry brings then a little more on the individual. I mean how are you guys thinking about Medicare Advantage longer term and then how did you position your bid for 2014?
Shawn M. Guertin
Well, I think Medicare Advantage is going to be a fine business long term. I\'ve always thought that. I even thought that when the rate notice came out this year not that it did not sort of shake me from that. We\'ve been preparing for a long time that we were going to get to revenue that was at a 100% of fee-for-service. Some of these announcements just accelerated that process a bit for us. So I continue to feel that this is a very good business for the long term.
You mentioned the group business and the exchanges, right, and that\'s an example of a trend that we will obviously continue to watch. Again, we play on both sides of this. We play on private exchanges. We sell individual MA and we sell group MA, so the various distribution avenues are something that certainly what we will be keeping our eye on and figuring out how to win in those different avenues.
\'14, it\'s as I mentioned it was a challenge from the rates. Everybody knows that now. We largely attack the problem by first trying to do everything we can with our own cost structure whether that\'s administrative expense or medical expenses or networks and medical management. Those are the kinds of things that save real money that they\'ll impinge on sort of the value to the customer. You certainly want to make sure you\'ve got every nickel of revenue that you think that you\'re entitled to on this business.
But then you\'re into things like premium benefits and maybe county exits. And what I would say is the solution was sort of no one of those things at the exclusion of others it was a very measured sort of solution and frankly it obviously varies market by market what we did but it was really spread across all those things. County exits were not a big part of our solution. I know that gets some play, but we really worked across cost structure, premium and benefits and tried our best to sort of hold our margins if we can.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Okay. So sorry, just reiterate that figure. You\'re goals toward next year is at best to hold your margins but understand there is pressure there. Is that right?
Shawn M. Guertin
Absolutely. I mean it\'s impossible for me not to say there\'s pressure when you think about just the gap between trend and revenue and everything you\'re going to have to do to bridge that gap. You would really be out on a very long limb to think margins would expand in the face of that.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
[indiscernible].
Shawn M. Guertin
Yeah, that\'s true too. We do have \xe2\x80\x93 obviously the two specific areas we talked about on the conference call are obviously and those particular areas we would be obviously correcting sort of margin profile of that product set but sort of in mass. I will not sort of think about it as an increasing margin business.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Okay. And then how you position \xe2\x80\x93 can you just discuss maybe how you position your products for \'14 and \'15 with the thought of longer term for \'16 and beyond, so are you willing to accept short-term margin pressure in certain counties that you might have been on the border of exiting with the understanding that you can turn around for later years?
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes, this is county by county to your point and so there are certainly counties where we\'ve really felt good about our footprint, our networks there and in those counties, right, we try to not do anything that was too short term in nature. And so those might have been places where we might have taken our foot off the margin a little bit and tried to wait for another day to fight.
And then in frankly some of the counties, the few counties that we did exit were counties where we just didn\'t think even in \'16 that our construct was such that we\'d have a long-term winning game plan and those are really the ones where we decided it would probably be better to pull out.
In many instances actually we did also have overlapping products and sometimes we might have pulled one side or the other out, but we actually had a more \xe2\x80\x93 a better position product on the other side of the house following the closing of the deal.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Okay. And you mentioned kind of networks in there as one of the driver. I assume it\'s about a number of members and networks actually that helps to find what can be an attractive market longer term. I mean how do you guys think about network and how are those discussions evolving as there seems to be more focus on network, et cetera, across Medicare, commercial, et cetera?
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes. No, I think that\'s right. I think \xe2\x80\x93 again, the buying decision used to sort of be do you have every hospital and every doc in the network and if you did not, then that was a problem. Clearly now it\'s not only a cost issue but I think the ability to managed care in a more effective way can happen in a smaller system. And I think you see that going on certainly in Medicare. If you think about it in a very simplistic sense in an exchange sort of consumer-oriented world, the consumer does not care as long as they\'re doc and hospital is in the network, right? So they don\'t necessarily even may not put a lot of value on a broad network. So both of those things I think are things that are narrowing sort of the network footprint size. I think we\'ve said in the past our exchange networks are pretty meaningfully smaller than our standard commercial networks I think is good evidence of that.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Okay. And maybe kind of related to that, just talk about your 8 tier strategy, I know you\'re pushing to get about 45% of your medical costs run through those relationships over the next, I guess, three, four years. Maybe how that evolved and what the impact of that is on the company?
Shawn M. Guertin
Well, it is \xe2\x80\x93 I would talk about this sometimes the words sort of mean different things to people, but if you think about collaborating with providers in a new and different way, in a way where our incentives are aligned with each other, in a way where we can exchange information and create better outcomes, that\'s really what Accountable Care\'s about. And in a generic sense it\'s all about provider collaboration. It is, as I mentioned, at the outset I think one of the longer term underpinnings of our strategy we believe that is \xe2\x80\x93 there will be a new network model in the future.
Sometimes people talk about it as instead of vertically integrating as a strategy, we\'re trying to create a virtual vertical integration type arrangement with providers using our technology stack. But it really is all of these things whether it\'s pressure on Medicare reimbursement, pressure on Medicaid reimbursement, whether it\'s having to deal in a retail environment on exchanges, it\'s all about cost structure. And cost structure in this business really comes from effective management of that sort of medical cost dollar and we believe Accountable Care, aligned incentives, provider collaborations that they\'re absolutely the way to go to win that.
So it\'s a long-term sort of factor that\'s on the critical path that we need to execute on. Again, some of these things three and four years out, the pace, it\'s difficult to predict because there\'s a lot of other things that could go on and change. And frankly providers \xe2\x80\x93 there\'s this spectrum just like we\'re talking about employers and exchanges, there\'s some providers who sort of see the writing on the wall, believe in this model today. They want to jump in with both feet and there\'s other providers who say, come back in two years. If I\'m having a problem then maybe we\'ll talk about it. So that also sort of factors into pace here. But it\'s a very important long-term initiative.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Okay, it makes sense. Maybe switching back a little bit, back towards government, Medicaid side of the business has been doing well with the Coventry deal, maybe talk about how you guys are positioning that and are there any RFTs or safe procurements you guys are particularly focused on at the moment?
Shawn M. Guertin
We look at everything. We scan the universe constantly for all these growth opportunities. Honestly though we have a lot on our plate right now. We have two dual contracts coming up for implementation in Ohio and Illinois. As you saw we were the partner who won the Arizona Behavioral Health bid. That\'s a service only relationship for us. We\'re not the insurer on that relationship, but nevertheless all of the hard work to implement and be ready for such a large contract that\'s going on. So we have a lot going on right now in Medicaid, but we\'ll continue to look. And it will be largely a function of what I talked about to some extent on exchanges. Can we build? Do we have a good footprint there already? If not, can you actually build a cost structure that\'s going to win? But we have a lot on our plate right now.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Okay. So you mentioned the two dual wins, can you maybe just talk a little bit more about how you guys think about the dual opportunity going forward? Obviously it\'s been a big area of focus and maybe if the timeline got pushed out a little bit.
Shawn M. Guertin
I think it\'s a very good opportunity. It might be one of the more attractive opportunities in the Medicaid space, but it seems to be sort of a theme of what I\'m saying today. It\'s happening slower, right, I think than anybody sort of maybe thought 12 months ago or 18 months ago. These are a little bit more difficult to get up. But this is not a business sort of for the faint of heart. I mean this is high revenue yields which make this a very attractive business, it\'s very revenue rich, but you really got to have a care management model that\'s effective for this business. The model that we actually used in Arizona was independently reviewed by CMS \xe2\x80\x93 I think was CMS and it was one of the highest scoring models.
So I feel very good about our capabilities and in fact on the two dual bids we went after were two for two on those bids. So I like it. I think it\'s a good opportunity but like I said, it\'s very revenue rich. Anytime you start getting revenue in $500 million chunks, you really got to make sure you got a strong care management model behind that and you\'re sort of ready to go at contract outset. That\'s a little bit why when I answered the question you don\'t want to get too far ahead of yourself in Medicaid because you really got to be ready day one to start going on these things.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
And I think that makes sense. I mean you mentioned the importance of care management there, obviously a high utilizing population. What are the skills you\'re bringing from Aetna is core businesses to that and maybe what are the things you\'ve learned or expect of not that you can maybe move back towards your commercial and core businesses?
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes, you\'re constantly sort of looking at this and looking back and forth. For example, both sides I think have gotten some good ideas just between us and Coventry and just maybe different ways to attack the same problem, and one looking a little bit more effective. But again we\'ve had a dual contract for a while. We\'ve had the Medicare Advantage business for a while, so I do think we have a good foundation that we\'re jumping off.
And I would say Aetna globally as a company is a company that never \xe2\x80\x93 it didn\'t forsake total cost management even when the rest of the world without their buying discounts, discounts, discounts, we really stuck to our guns to say no. The right answer is sort of total cost management. So I view it sort of in the DNA of the company almost how we think about the business is all about care management and care management models and always making those better year-after-year.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Okay. And in thinking about people buying down a little bit here, cost trend came in better than expected. Utilization continues to be weak on the provider\'s side. I mean how are you guys thinking about utilization for the second half of this year and then heading in for next year when you price your products, I mean what kind of underlying trend were you expecting?
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes. So we have not been specific about 2014 yet, but as we said coming into this year, I think 2014 in particular is a year where probably discretion is the better part of dollar in our pricing. And we\'ve put the anticipatory trend increases. Last year we assumed this year it would go up 50 basis points on the utilization side. Heretofore, that really has not manifested itself out there. Our assumption largely is, is that will be the story for the balance of the year. So I think we would probably take that same tact and have \xe2\x80\x93 on our early position I think we should err on the side of caution going into \'14 just with all of the new sort of uncertain items that are coming up and especially with things like Medicare as we\'ve talked about.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
I was thinking maybe a little bit relates to that. I assume on the commercial side you were able to price and the industry fee and the non-tax deductibility of that. How did that play out in your Medicare and Medicaid books and how are you \xe2\x80\x93 what is your success in being able to go convince Medicaid state that that is part of the cost status?
Shawn M. Guertin
Just on commercial, I\'ll get there, it is so far so good. I\'ve actually been quite pleased with what we\'ve been able to get approved in rate filings, what we\'ve been able to do in the market. That\'s largely because everybody else has to do the same thing. So, so far so good. Now the bulk of our business is the January 1 renewal and it\'s probably a little bit too early, in fact it is too early to declare a victory on the January 1 cohort, but so far so good I think on the commercial side.
Medicare, it\'s not an element of the rates you\'re going to get paid, so just like anything else in that equation it\'s something we need to solve for. So you already had a big gap. That made the gap bigger. When I think about \'14 and the three or four things that you really got to execute on, solving for that gap is one of them and that\'s underway now and we will kind of continue to work on that for the balance of the year going into \'14. But there was already a big lift there. So that\'s just one more challenge and what I think could be a challenging year for Medicare next year.
Medicaid, this at times is almost like a metaphysical question of what do you mean? Did you recover it or not? The good news is and this is a small sample size of what I\'ve seen so far is it is showing up as an explicit rate item and I think that\'s good. The issue that I\'ve always had is there are umpteen other rating factors that could be pulled up and down to account for that or not if somebody chose to. So at the end of the day, I look at it and say if I\'ve maintained my operating margin then I\'ve recovered the tax.
And if I did not, then I probably did not. I still would stand by that. I think this will be one of the more challenging places to "recover it" just because the state budgets are pressured, as you all know, margins are already sort of low single digits on this business. There\'s just not as many places to go as you can. But I\'m actually pleasantly surprised that we\'re getting such explicit recognition of it at least upfront in the rate, certainly better than the alternative.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Okay. Changing gears real fast for the last minute here, you\'ve estimated ending the year with over 1 billion and something cash, maybe talk us through expense, quite a bit already, but talk us through maybe your capital deployment goals for the rest of this year and maybe going forward as well?
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes. So our \xe2\x80\x93 and sort of order of priority my first priority with capital is to always grow the business. And the biggest, biggest wean on that capital is when we get into growth. And so when we have strong premium growth, we need more regulatory capital that reduces the amount of deployable cash, but it\'s also our best return on capital. So I really want to put the money there.
M&A because of the Coventry deal in particular is not really in the forefront of our thinking right now. We certainly have enough on our plate with the integration but then you would be back to what we\'ve done historically which is a deployment between share repurchase and the dividend and I think probably Aetna has been as aggressive as any company in this space with being capital efficient and putting that capital to work and returning that to shareholders in the most aggressive form that we can.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley
Great. I think we\'re out of time, so thank you very for being here, Shawn.
Shawn M. Guertin
Thank you.
