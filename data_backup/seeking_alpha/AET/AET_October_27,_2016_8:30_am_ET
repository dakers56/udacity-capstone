Good morning. My name is Michelle and I\'ll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Aetna Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on a mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Krocheski. You may begin.
Joseph F. Krocheski - Aetna, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for joining Aetna\'s third quarter 2016 earnings call and webcast. This is Joe Krocheski, Vice President of Investor Relations for Aetna, and with me this morning are Aetna\'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Bertolini; and Chief Financial Officer, Shawn Guertin. Following the prepared portion of the remarks, we will answer your questions. Karen Lynch, Aetna\'s President, will also join us for the Q&A session.
As a reminder, during this call we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in this morning\'s press release and the reports we file with the SEC. We have also provided reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures in our press release and guidance summary. These reconciliations are available on the Investor Information section of aetna.com.
Finally, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in non-public forums is limited, so we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?
Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.
Good morning. Thank you, Joe; and thank you all for joining us today. This morning Aetna reported third quarter operating EPS of $2.07 driven by 10% year-over-year growth in operating earnings.
Underlying our solid third quarter performance, we grew membership sequentially by 143,000 members across Large Group Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. We grew operating revenue by 5% to $15.7 billion. Operating results in our Government business remain robust. We continue to drive operating efficiencies as evidenced by our 17.6% adjusted operating expense ratio and we achieved high single digit pre-tax operating margins consistent with our long-term target. We are pleased with our third quarter results which continue to reflect the solid performance of our core businesses. As we look to the final quarter of 2016, we continue to expect strong operating performance in our core businesses and have refined our operating EPS projection to $7.95 to $8.05 per share.
While performance in the quarter and year-to-date reflects many elements of our growth strategy. The main pillars of the strategy are: positioning Aetna to participate in key industry growth drivers, particularly in government-sponsored programs; leading the evolution of the provider model from volume to value-based care; and transforming Aetna into a consumer-centric company. While the Humana acquisition enhances these efforts, let me spend a few minutes discussing the progress we have made year-to-date delivering on these strategic pillars.
Beginning with growing our Government business, the performance of our Medicare business continues to be very strong. During the quarter we grew medical membership by nearly 50,000 members sequentially, drove year-over-year quarterly premium growth of more than 17% and produced solid operating margins consistent with our targeted range. We have also positioned the company to continue to grow in Medicare by expanding our geographic footprint, providing over 4 million additional eligible Medicare beneficiaries access to Aetna MA products beginning with this annual election period, improving our stars performance for the third consecutive year, achieving over 90% of membership in four-star or greater plans, best-in-class among our publicly traded peers, and introducing proprietary group MA exchange solutions that produced multiple group contract wins for January 2017.
Our strong membership growth in Medicare Advantage speaks to the execution of our growth strategy in Medicare. Looking forward, we believe we are well-positioned to carry this momentum throughout this current annual election period and beyond.
Shifting to our Medicaid business, from a financial performance perspective, our Medicaid business is having another good year. More specifically, in the third quarter we added nearly 50,000 members. We grew quarterly premiums by nearly 13% compared to the same period last year and we are on track to achieve our pre-tax operating margin target for the year. From a longer-term perspective, we continue to see opportunities for Aetna to grow in Medicaid. While disappointed by the results of our procurement efforts in a number of important Medicaid contracts this year, we have taken what we have learned from these experiences to develop a refreshed approach to our procurement process. Combined with our already strong capabilities in managing Medicaid members, particularly high-acuity populations, we are confident in our ability to grow our Medicaid business. Our recent selection to participate in Virginia\'s Managed LTSS and Nevada\'s Managed Medicaid programs, speaks to Aetna\'s underlying capabilities to effectively serve these populations.
We also continue to advance our efforts to help transform the Health Care System. Over 40% of Aetna\'s medical spend currently runs through some form of value-based care model today and we are making solid progress to achieving our 2020 goal of 75%. Our collaborations with health care providers span a wide spectrum of value-based care models, including joint-ventures. Our value-based care efforts are not limited to collaborations with physicians and hospital systems. Earlier this month, we announced that Merck will be among the first companies to participate in AetnaCare, an innovative approach which uses predictive analytics to identify target populations and proactively curate various health and wellness services that are available. In coordination with a patient\'s physicians and caregivers, the program will aim to support treatment adherence, ensure that critical support needs are met, and reinforce healthy lifestyle behaviors. We are also collaborating with Merck in a previously disclosed value-based contract for the treatment of diabetes. Through this value-based contract, Merck and Aetna will work to advance our common goal of helping patients with type 2 diabetes effectively manage their condition to enable them to maximize their number of healthy days.
Shifting to our consumer engagement efforts, we made meaningful progress in the quarter and year-to-date to transform Aetna into a consumer-centric company. Specifically, we continue to use our bswift platform to enhance the consumer shopping and enrollment experience. For 2017, members in many of our Group Medicare Advantage and Small Group plans will have access to bswift\'s decision support tools and intuitive user interface, creating a more user-friendly and analytically driven enrollment experience.
We also announced a collaboration with Apple combining the power of iOS apps and the unmatched consumer experience of Apple with Aetna\'s strong expertise in data-based wellness and care management programs. With support from Apple, we plan to develop several health initiatives starting with apps that engage consumers. We are excited by this opportunity as we continue to drive Aetna\'s consumer-centric transformation.
Before I turn the call over to Shawn to discuss our third quarter results in more detail, I would like to say a few words about the proposed Humana acquisition.
We began this journey over 18 months ago and despite Humana\'s Medicare star ratings performance, we remain convinced to the strategic and financial merits of the acquisition. The Humana acquisition will accelerate our three main strategic pillars, enabling the combined company to provide more competitive products with a more engaging consumer experience to help people we serve achieve their personal health goals. We remain committed to defending our acquisition in court and we are confident that we will close the transaction.
In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders, as well as those employees at both Aetna and Humana who continue to work tirelessly to plan a successful integration.
I will now turn the call over to Shawn who will provide additional insight into our third quarter results, our updated 2016 outlook, and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2017. Shawn?
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
Thank you, Mark; and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2016 operating earnings of $734 million, a 10% increase over the prior-year quarter and operating earnings per share of $2.07. Aetna\'s operating results continue to be supported by solid top-line growth, cash flow, and operating margins. I\'ll begin with some comments on overall performance.
From a top-line perspective, we grew medical membership sequentially by 143,000 to over 23.1 million and we grew operating revenue by 5% over the prior year to $15.7 billion driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in our Government business, partially offset by membership attrition in our Individual and Small Group Commercial products.
From an operating margin perspective, our portfolio of businesses is performing quite well. Our pre-tax operating margin was 8.5%, a very strong result and consistent with our target operating margin range. Our third quarter Total Health medical benefit ratio was 82%, a good result overall but one that continues to be impacted by the performance of our ACA compliant Small Group and Individual products. Our adjusted operating expense ratio was 17.6%, a 100 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2015. This year-over-year improvement speaks to our disciplined focus on managing our operating cost as we continue to grow our top-line. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to second-quarter dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth and days claims payable were 57 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of about one day and a year-over-year increase of almost three days.
Turning to cash flow and capital. Year-to-date operating cash flows have been strong. Health care and group insurance operating cash flows were approximately 2.1 times operating earnings, driven by strong operating results and the timing of Medicare premium receipts as we received an advance payment in the quarter associated with October 2016. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter; however, we did return $88 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our third quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy.
I will now discuss the key drivers of our third quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our commercial fee-based business, which continues to perform well, we added 117,000 ASC members in the quarter driven by several new public and labor customers. This added membership, combined with fee yields, drove solid year-over-year fee revenue growth of 4%. Pre-tax operating margins also remained healthy continuing the trend from the first half of the year. In our Commercial Insured business, our membership declined by roughly 70,000 members in the quarter, primarily the result of attrition in our Individual and Small Group membership, directionally consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 83.8% for the quarter. This result reflects the continuation of medical cost pressure in our ACA compliant Individual and Small Group products.
Let me spend a few moments quantifying the impact of our ACA compliant products in more detail. Beginning with our Individual products, our third quarter Commercial MBR reflects ongoing challenges with these products, as well as an increase in the premium deficiency reserve to $85 million from $65 million at the end of the second quarter. Based on our third quarter results, our full-year pre-tax operating loss in our Individual Commercial products is now projected to be approximately $350 million, further validating our decision to reduce our 2017 exposure to these products.
Moving onto our ACA compliant Small Group insured products. Our underwriting results in the third quarter were pressured by the previously disclosed higher morbidity of this population combined with our updated estimate of 2016 risk adjustment payables which further pressured our Commercial MBR in the quarter.
While our ACA compliant products continue to weigh on 2016 results, we are confident that our strategic decision to reduce our footprint will reduce our financial exposure to these products in 2017. Based on year-to-date results, the majority of our Group Commercial products are performing largely consistent with our expectation for moderately increasing medical trend. As a result, we continue to project that our 2016 non-ACA core Commercial medical cost trends will be in the 6% to 7% range.
Shifting to our Government business; our strong first half momentum extended into the third quarter. We grew medical membership by nearly 100,000 members in the quarter including growth of 20,000 Medicare Advantage, 30,000 Medicare Supplement, and 47,000 Medicaid members. As a result of this strong medical membership growth, we grew our third quarter 2016 government premiums by nearly 16% compared to the prior-year period to $6.6 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total health care premiums. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 80.1%, a very strong result driven by year-over-year improvement in both Medicare and Medicaid.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At September 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 53%, which reflects the debt financing that we completed in June to fund the pending Humana acquisition. Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $317 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $88 million, and excluding the funds raised from our debt financing in June, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash at the parent. Including the funds from the June debt financing, we ended the quarter with approximately $15.2 billion. Our basic share count was approximately 351 million at September 30.
Based on our year-to-date performance, we are refining our 2016 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.95 to $8.05 per share. This reflects continued strong performance in our Government business and continued focus on operating costs offset by our updated margin projections for our ACA compliant products. Our updated 2016 guidance also reflects our year-end membership projection of approximately 23 million members, with ACA compliant Small Group and Individual membership attrition projected to be the largest driver of membership movement in the fourth quarter. The balance of our 2016 guidance metrics remain unchanged and can be found on our guidance summary.
Looking beyond 2016, with the DOJ trial date set for December, we are now planning for a 2017 closing of the Humana acquisition. We believe the strategic underpinnings of the combination and the financial case remain strong. While development since we announced the transaction have altered some of the specific parts, the sum of these parts is still within our set of initial assumptions. We don\'t typically provide forward-year guidance on our third quarter call and will not do so today. However, with the potential for a 2017 closing of the Humana acquisition, I want to provide directional commentary on some of the notable moving pieces that are likely to influence our initial projections for Aetna\'s 2017 baseline earnings.
While we are still early in the forecasting process, we see a number of challenges in 2017. From an operating revenue perspective, these include the previously disclosed reduction in our individual public exchange footprint, the projected impact of the suspension of the health insurer fee, the projected impact of known Medicaid contract losses, and the projected impact of our continued strategy to improved margins in our Small Group ACA products. We project these top-line challenges will pressure our ability to grow operating revenue in 2017. However, we believe the Humana acquisition has the potential to mitigate these top-line challenges.
We also see opportunities in 2017, including the projection for continued above-industry growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage products driven by our industry-leading stars position, the projection that our reduced Individual public exchange footprint will improve the financial performance of these products in 2017 as compared to 2016 and the projection for year-over-year improvement in the financial performance of our Small Group ACA products.
In closing, as we begin the final quarter of 2016 and continue our planning for 2017 we remain encouraged by the strength of our third quarter and year-to-date results despite some meaningful challenges. We also remain confident that we can close the Humana transaction and are committed to realizing our long-term growth objectives. I will now turn the call back over to Joe. Joe?
Joseph F. Krocheski - Aetna, Inc.
Thank you, Shawn. The Aetna management team is now ready for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question so that as many individuals as possible have an opportunity to ask their questions. Operator, the first question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
A.J. Rice - UBS
Thanks. Hello, everybody. Maybe just following up on Shawn\'s comments there towards the end of the prepared remarks. If you were to think about it from an operating income standpoint, it seems to me you\'ve got some positive things happening like the elimination of your exchange losses and the potential for capital deployment either in buying Humana or restarting your share repurchase program. Alternatively, you\'ve had some favorable PYD this year that you probably typically don\'t \xe2\x80\x93 at least don\'t guide for. Can you maybe \xe2\x80\x93 can we get you to comment a little bit about the tailwinds and headwinds as it relates to operating income? And your thoughts about that?
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
I\'m not going to, again, provide guidance on operating income on this call. I will just offer some comments though on what you said. You are correct. It\'s been our long-held convention that our initial guidance for any calendar year excludes the effect of prior-year development. That adjustment would be between $0.40 and $0.45 for this year, and at this point we have no intention to change that convention. In terms of the capital deployment, you are right. In the event that we will have some capital, whether that capital goes to the Humana deal or other uses is to be determined. The allocation of that capital is something that we still need to determine. As you recall, our first priority always with capital is to do something to sort of grow the business and add long-term value, and then we consider some of the other uses like share repurchase and the shareholder dividend. The final comment I\'d make on the Individual business is I would not get so bullish to think that we are eliminating all the loss in that business next year. I think, we have taken steps to improve that outcome, but from where we\'ve come on this, I do not think that that is something that one should assume at this point.
A.J. Rice - UBS
Okay. All right. Thanks, Shawn.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Also I guess just to clarify the comment you made, Shawn, that you\'ve got $0.40 to $0.45 of favorable development in the 2016 number. If we think about that $8 midpoint, is there any other adjustment to the run rate 2016 that we should think about?
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
I don\'t think there\'s anything really material. Obviously we\'ve had sort of a prior-year drag, but that\'s embedded in the individual loss that we\'ve talked about. So I think that\'s a fairly clean adjustment.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay.
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
But that was a number, Josh, that we didn\'t have any capital deployment during the year.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Right. Right. So I mean \xe2\x80\x93 and that was sort of my next question is even if you \xe2\x80\x93 even if the deal doesn\'t close and you pay $1 billion breakup fee and you retire the debt with a 1% penalty, you\'re still going to end the year with, I don\'t know, $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion of cash, it sounds like, plus obviously any cash you generate next year. Is there any reason to think that at these levels share buybacks wouldn\'t be the first priority? Would you guys consider an accelerated buyback in a situation like that? Or how should we think about the timing of that deployment?
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
Yeah. Again, I don\'t want to lock in prematurely sort of to an answer on this. As I mentioned, our first priority actually with that capital at the parent is always to grow the business. Now having said that, I don\'t think it\'s unreasonable that there would be some degree of share repurchase next year with the use of that capital, but whether the magnitude of that, whether we do an ASR, a lot of that is still to be determined.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And then did you quantify the actual revenue reduction on the health insurance exchange? Just sizing, I know, you\'re saying that you\'re not going to eliminate all of the losses, but is there even like a revenue parameter that we could say in terms of where you were this year versus next year?
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
Yeah. So the total individual block is projected to be about $4 billion of revenue this year. The on-exchange portion of that for 2016 that we\'re exiting is about $2.7 billion. There will likely be some additional attrition in the off-exchange business, but that is still to be determined. We\'re going to need to see how that plays out in enrollment, but I would think about the $2.7 billion as being the biggest chunk of what\'s going to happen year-over-year. It\'ll likely turn out to be a bit more than that.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Just to follow-up on this Individual number. The $2.7 billion is what you\'re exiting, that\'s the 80% of membership that you talked about on-exchange walking away from?
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
Yes. That is the 2016 revenue estimate for the on-exchange markets that we\'re exiting.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. And then as you think about the other exits out there and the growth, I\'m curious in terms of the fact that you expect attrition despite the fact that others are leaving and then your price increases in it. Can you give us a ballpark? Like do you think this thing will be down from $4 billion to $2 billion? Or do you think it\'ll be down even less than that?
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
I really can\'t at this point which is some of why we\'re not sort of getting out too far on guidance because this is one element of that for sure. But let me be clear. When I was speaking to attrition, I was speaking specifically to the off-exchange markets, where I do think we will see some attrition. Whether we \xe2\x80\x93 the degree of growth in the markets we stay in, again that is still to be determined as we go through the enrollment process. And as you point out, there\'s a lot of variables there in terms of other carrier exits, rate increases, and things like that.
Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.
I\'d like to remind everybody that we are not yet done with our 2017 operating plan. So we have yet to present that to our board and therefore not ready to give any guidance.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. I guess just a couple of other directional questions on 2017 that hopefully you can comment on. First, the timing on the health industry tax, I think you had said for this year, just the way in the Commercial the way the premiums work, it was a $0.10 headwind. I think it\'s supposed to be a $0.20 benefit next year, so effectively a $0.30 tailwind.
Just wanted to confirm that that will be the case for 2017 and then reverse itself in 2018. And then just any comments on SG&A from a high level given that the \xe2\x80\x93 how we should think about SG&A leverage in the next year given the revenue losses? And that will be it from me. Thanks.
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
Yeah. So on SG&A, obviously in a traditional sense, leverage will be more challenged than it certainly has been the last few years. We certainly made good progress over the last two years not only on leverage, but in overall productivity gains within our SG&A. Obviously losing some of the Medicaid contracts, exiting these exchange markets, the level of SG&A activity to sort of right-size our business in proportion to that is something that\'s a key part of next year. On the health insurer fee, in concept you\'re correct. It turned out a little \xe2\x80\x93 we\'re probably a little bit closer on 2016 than your $0.10, so I\'m not sure that\'s as big a pickup. Obviously we are going to have to start recovering the 2018 in our 2017 pricing just like we had to do back in 2013 and 2014. And we will be following, as of right now, the same process that we used in 2013 to begin to recover the 2014 HIF.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Yes. Hi. Thank you. Good morning. On the Small Group business, would you be able to do any similar sizing of that business as you\'ve done on the Individual side? I don\'t know whether you can break that out between, if it matters, between ACA compliant and non-ACA compliant. And maybe give us some sense of how much attrition you might be expecting going into next year.
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
Just in terms of sizing, that business is about 55%, I think, ACA right now. And that\'s a little bit higher than I think we were a year ago but not a lot. On overall Small Group, this is another one that\'s difficult to project. On the non-ACA business, a lot of that is renewing in December, so we need to see how that plays out. There\'s a large concentration of business there, but it is a little bit difficult at this point to estimate what\'s going to happen with the Small Group ACA block. And as Mark mentioned, that\'s something we\'re kind of actively working through right now.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.
And then just somewhat separate, as you look at what you\'ve got for January 1, has this been a \xe2\x80\x93 building on some commentary I think you gave last quarter, how would you characterize the 1/1 enrollment process for this year?
Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.
Matt, it\'s Karen. From a national perspective, as I said last quarter, we saw lighter RFP volume just generally across the industry. We feel we\'re pleased with sort of getting our fair share in those new sales. We\'re pleased with our retention, which is in the high 90%s, but as I said on the Commercial book, we will not be showing growth there. It\'s a little bit different story on the Group Medicare side as I had mentioned previously. We had a robust sales season, robust RFP activity. We had strong sales there to offset one of our large losses. So we\'re pleased with the strength of our value proposition in the Group Medicare space as well.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, Karen. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks. I want to talk about the Government business a little bit. Because couple of revenue challenges you talked about, the HIF and the declining footprint, are both positive from an earnings point of view. So it\'s really the Medicaid business contraction that\'s sort of negative from an earnings point of view. So I\'d like to talk about exactly why you lost the states you lost, how many states are still in protest at this point, and so talk about sort of the overall revenue loss in the Medicaid business and in the Group MA business and that conversion. That has a significant positive impact on revenue. Can you talk about that impact on revenue for 2017?
Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.
Yeah. Let me just comment on the Medicaid business. Although we are disappointed in our recent losses \xe2\x80\x93 and I would tell you we are very confident in our overall capabilities in that business, particularly our integrated care management model. And I think that\'s evidenced by some of our recent wins in our LTSS contracts in Virginia and our Nevada Medicaid contract. One of the things that we have done is we\'ve done a big analysis and a robust analysis of the reasons why we lost some of those big contracts, and I am confident that we are changing our procurement process and we are repositioning the way we write our RFP. So, relative to the Medicaid business, as I would say, we expect reduction in overall revenue next year from our losses, but I think we\'re positioning ourselves for future wins in that business.
Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Specifically, what is that revenue loss that you\'re expecting for next year? And what\'s still under protest?
Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.
The two contracts, if I put in Missouri and Nebraska, would be about $750 million of impact next year.
Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then Pennsylvania is still being rebid.
Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.
And then under protest \xe2\x80\x93 Pennsylvania bid is under protest and that\'s almost $1 billion in revenue.
Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And how do you expect the outcome of the Pennsylvania rebid to go for you guys?
Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.
It\'s hard to say, obviously we put our best foot forward relative to the rebid and we expect to know sometime between now and the end of the year.
Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then in terms of the Group MA conversion? What\'s the revenue impact of that? When you lose national account lives, it\'s usually ASO fees and then becoming Group MA, that\'s a premium, a very significant premium for those lives.
Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.
Yeah. We\'re not giving guidance for 2017 at this point.
Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC
Hi, there. One for each of you. First of all, when you guys announced that you were exiting a lot of your ACA on-exchange business, you\'d indicated that you were seeing off-exchange. Is that still the case for a lot of those counties? And what\'s to stop adverse selection with your and others exiting on-exchange on the off-exchange business? And that\'s probably for Shawn. And then \xe2\x80\x93 or Mark. And then, Mark, do you have any idea of how we could fix the ACA? What do you need to see to get back it?
Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.
Well, Christine, we will be staying in off-exchange, but in a much reduced footprint that allows us the capability should the regulations and the law get right in order to reenter exchanges. But that probably won\'t be much before \xe2\x80\x93 it won\'t be before 2019, more likely 2020. What needs to change is largely around the risk adjustment mechanism. Right now we have a risk adjustment mechanism that has a centering point on the average population in the pool. The population in the pool is largely people who are too young for Medicare, chronically ill and older. And until that changes, the center point is probably 10% to 15% below breakeven.
So if you look at industry losses based on the revenue associated with it, they pretty much track to that number. So what we have in a zero-sum risk adjustment mechanism is a mechanism that takes people who are losing less money and taking that money and giving it to people who are losing more money, so everybody loses the same money. And until that mechanism changes, or until the pool substantively changes, we\'re going to find ourselves in a premium spiral that\'s going to continue to drive rates up, good risk out, and ultimately create a very bad risk pool for the overall mechanism.
Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC
So when you announced that you were exiting on-exchange, I thought your press release indicated, and I could be wrong, that you were staying in the majority of your off-exchange counties and areas. Did that change since the press release? Or am I misremembering?
Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.
Christine, what you have is a reduced number of, plus a pretty substantially reduced number of plan offerings in those geographies, as well as a much-reduced marketing presence in those geographies. So we expect that will serve to mitigate some of the pressure that we\'ve had there this year. Conceptually in any given market, could there be more anti-selection to hit that book? Of course. I mean this book has proven difficult to predict over the last three years. The thing I would say is behind our decision-making here, this was really about risk management and we wanted to reduce the capital commitment behind this business, we wanted to reduce the losses and frankly we wanted to reduce the variability in outcome of those losses in terms of, sort of, establishing that footprint and what the plan offerings are.
So if you were to look at our off-exchange footprint, the reason we had to announce by August 15 was that the off-exchange markets we were withdrawing from, particularly the types of products, would presage our inability to maintain on-exchange presence. So that\'s sort of the way to look at it. Our off-exchange product offerings and markets sort of gave a heads up to everybody who is calling the insurance department every month that we were going to be pulling off of on-exchange markets by September 23.
Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. So we have a lot of markets that were in off-exchange, but we\'re not talking about it. That\'s reduced marketing presence \xe2\x80\x93 market presence \xe2\x80\x93 marketing. And then we\'re going to have fewer plans. Is that the right way to think about it?
Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.
Yeah.
Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Just wondered if you could maybe give us five enrollment numbers. And then I had a clarification too. But on the enrollment, if you could just run us through \xe2\x80\x93 I\'m sorry, ACA compliant on- and off-exchange, Individual, non-compliant Individual, and then same for Small Group, compliant and non-compliant?
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
Okay. So virtually all of our Individual business is ACA compliant. In the third quarter, we have about 775,000 members on-exchange and about 270,000 off-exchange. In terms of Small Group, we have about 1 million risk members total in Small Group and about 550,000 of those are a Small Group ACA.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. And then my clarification was the $350 million loss. That\'s a net income figure or a pre-tax figure?
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
Pre-tax.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Pre-tax. And that\'s only for the compliant business both on and off which is essentially all your Individual?
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
That\'s correct.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (
Thanks. Just wanted to stick on Small Group for a second and can you also just sort of walk us through where you estimate the Small Group margins are now going to trend for 2016 and if you can break that out between off and/or ACA compliant and not, that would be great. And then just the follow-up would just be around the pricing environment for Small Group for next year and how competitive you see it for next year or not, and sort of, the potential to push up the margins in the context of the pricing for next year?
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
If you thought about our Small Group business, you should really think about it in three blocks, if you will. There is the 51 to 100 business that is not subject to ACA. Margin wise, that business is fine, at target margins, maybe even a hair better. We also have the 2 to 50 that is to keep what you have that is not in the ACA yet. That business is performing fine. So the only one that is off is the Small Group ACA business and that business is probably running a modest pre-tax loss for 2016. I would say low single-digits is the way that looks right now. The pricing question is a difficult one to answer in the sense that if you\'re dealing with selection issues as we saw this year, the traditional pricing lever that works in stable environments doesn\'t always have the desired effect. So I would say at a high level, the pricing environment has been fine. But I think the issues with the Small Group ACA block require things other than pricing in order to potentially improve the outcome there.
Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.
So, I would just comment that we continue to see a deterioration in the risk pool for Small Group ACA and although that \xe2\x80\x93 there\'s been a lot of struggles in this segment, we are seeing sort of the better risk looking at alternatives. So we are offering alternative product funds. (41:51) We also are seeing that book move to PEOs and the good news is, we have products in both of those areas to offer those Small Group ACA clients.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (
Karen, any view on why the Small Group risk pool is getting worse here? Obviously we\'re not seeing the Individual pool getting any better so we know that it\'s not that you\'re having a favorable Small Group risk sort of swap into Individual. So any sense on why that pool is deteriorating as well?
Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.
It is operating very similar to the Individual ACA book, and it is in certain geographies, as I\'ve talked about before, so it\'s not widespread, so we\'re seeing it emerge, but I would say that we\'ve got very good targeted strategies to really \xe2\x80\x93 you have to really understand all the risk dynamics and we\'ve got very good target strategies to address that, including pricing.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC
Thank you. Good morning. I\'d like to follow-up on the changes you mentioned in the way you approach Medicaid procurement. In your mind, is there anything about the capabilities of your Medicaid platform that need to be fixed or enhanced or is the issue more just about the way you actually write the contract and the submission in terms of getting a good score?
Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.
We\'re really confident in our capabilities and our integrated care management model is stellar. We believe it is a very strong model. I think as I mentioned, as evidenced by some of our recent wins, and really I think, is a fundamental process of changing the way in which we go about procurement and we\'ve got leadership very focused on working that activity.
Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.
Yeah. Michael, let me support that even more. When you think about \xe2\x80\x93 we have consistently been able, once we have these contracts, to sort of deliver improved quality, lower costs and for all of you, target margins. And I would just look at what we were able to do in Kentucky in terms of turning that around. Karen mentioned sort of some independent scoring of our care model by CMS. So when we have this business, I think, it is indisputable that we have the capabilities to create good outcomes. So going back to Karen\'s point, this is a front-end procurement issue that we need to focus on.
Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC
And were you able to make any of these changes for your rebid in Pennsylvania?
Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.
Yes, we were.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Good morning. I just was hoping to get some additional clarification on the $350 million of losses in the Individual book. I\'m assuming it\'s split between both the off- and the on-exchange but can you give us a sense for how it\'s split between the two? Is a majority \xe2\x80\x93 a vast majority of it in the on-exchange, which I think it is? But then more importantly when we look to next year in the residual off-exchange book, do you think the losses there will get worse or will they go down? Thanks.
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
Two things. One is, there is substantial loss in that $350 million on both on- and off-exchange. Proportionate to the membership, it is a bit more disproportional to the off-exchange on a per-member basis but both sides of that equation are making up large components of the $350 million loss. Obviously, it\'s our intent to decrease the loss on that off-exchange business. The variable in that, though, is still to be played out through the enrollment process in terms of what levels of volume we get or don\'t get on that business.
Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.
We used four factors to try and size our participation for next year. One was the amount of capital at risk in any given market. We have seen in some states a fairly significant shift from 2015 to 2016 in the financial performance of those businesses. Secondly, we use the competitive frame, how many people are in the market. When you\'re the last one left in the market, you get all the risk and there isn\'t any risk to share. The third was whether or not we could continue to offer a broad enough product offering without putting that much capital at risk, including the sizable loss in any one given market. And the fourth was regulatory framework within the market itself.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On the operating expense picture, can you comment perhaps on maybe the factor or factors that have been most contributory to your savings? Second part of that would be to what extent has the operating expense margin benefited from a shift in mix toward government business? And then, third, are there any perhaps major initiatives that are on hold per se pending the Humana deal?
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
I\'ll take the first couple and then turn it to Mark, but you\'re right, Dave, and we can follow up with the specifics. As we\'ve grown government that has a lower expense ratio, so that\'s helped but make no mistake, we have a pretty concerted effort to improve productivity throughout the company. That\'s been in place for a couple of years now. It\'s in some way still ramping up, but as I mentioned in our previous call, I think you\'re beginning to see the fruits of that initiative this year in terms of where we are on the maturity.
So the kinds of things we\'re doing through that effort are not temporary hold-backs of spending. They are things that both improve the quality of the end product to the customer, but also make us more efficient. So when we grow, this is a high fixed expense business, so we always get some form of leverage. That has helped. This productivity initiative has also contributed significantly to that as well.
Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.
And I think it\'s that productivity initiative that feeds into the integration discussion we\'re having with Humana. The work we\'re doing is value stream Six Sigma-level work where we\'re taking each business process and the employees in that process to evaluate and develop a better customer experience, and we\'ve seen a lot of that happen in Medicare already, which is yielding a high outcome on our stars ratings, and we continue to move that across the business. We are not fully embedded.
As it relates to the Humana transaction, there are a number of opportunities that we view as earlier wins for us in expanding to more markets. However, that is not putting our own expansion efforts on hold. We continue to do the work that we expected to do in anticipation of our plan as it was before we did the Humana transaction. We are looking at some systems investments as opportunities with Humana, but you have a tradeoff. We may get some benefits out of the Humana acquisition in the way of technology investments, in the way of program investments, but we\'re also going to have to make investments in the company, in Humana in fixing things like the large commercial business, et cetera. All of that tradeoff is really a deployment of capital discussion, and quite frankly in the end, we\'re continuing to move ahead with our plan as if the Humana acquisition didn\'t happen.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC
Got it. If I could just clarify on a membership question. So for Karen, if I understand your response to an earlier question, the national accounts is essentially a push in terms of high retention but also limited activity in new sales and then group MA is also a push, good sales activity offsetting a conversion. Do I understand that correctly?
Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.
I would say that you should see modest growth in group Medicare and then we\'ll have less attrition in national accounts than we did last year.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Lance Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Good morning. Could you just give an update on for prior period development, how much of that was in the government space and Medicaid specifically? And then related to that, strategically, what\'s your appetite in the Medicaid space and what capabilities would you be looking at if you were to ultimately do some strategic capital deployment there?
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
Lance, we don\'t disclose specifically prior-period development and/or even by product. What I would tell you is that all three of our major product lines, commercial Medicare and Medicaid, all experienced favorable development in the quarter with that mainly being attributable to second quarter. Again, the Medicaid discussion is one that goes back to our prior discussion, which is from a core capability standpoint, in terms of when we have these contracts, I think our track record is actually very good in terms of the results. So this continues to be about the procurement side of this, and we\'re certainly going to attack that organically because we think it\'s something that we can and should be able to fix.
Lance Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Great. And if you were looking at any of the capabilities on the LTC side or some of the PBM aspects of that, would any of those do you feel are lacking?
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
Certainly, our LTSS performance actually even in procurement to some extent but even the business we have has actually been very good. So I probably would say, at this level of discussion, I couldn\'t think of anything there.
Karen S. Lynch - Aetna, Inc.
Yeah, I would just echo Shawn\'s comments there. I think our underlying performance of our capabilities is strong in our Medicaid business.
Lance Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks.

Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Great. Thanks. Sorry about that earlier. I guess two questions; first, it sounds like the individual business has gotten worse, but you\'re exiting a lot of the markets. Would you say that the deterioration is more skewed towards either the business you\'re staying in or the business that you\'re leaving?
Shawn M. Guertin - Aetna, Inc.
It is worse, and I would say that it\'s difficult to say whether off of one quarter I wouldn\'t want to make a directional comment out of this. I think we still feel \xe2\x80\x93 Mark described a framework before that we use to assess this from a business perspective and that framework was really more of an enterprise risk management framework than it was a market-by-market seriatim buildup. So I think looking at it today, I think we still feel good about trying to stay in the box that we established for next year. Having said that, we really need to go through the enrollment process and see how each of these markets on- and off-exchange play out.
Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.
Remember we\'re still working off of weekly data, which is incomplete and has a lot of potential movement in it. So these are estimates still at this point in time.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And then you mentioned before that, obviously, you\'re not going to be able to get rid of all the exchange losses, but if we said that you were going to exit, I guess, call it 70% of your revenue, and let\'s just assume it meant 70% of the losses on the exchanges, are you talking about the fact that you\'re going to keep 30% of the losses or that even on that 70% of the losses, those don\'t all go away because it\'s fixed cost? If it\'s the latter, how do we think about the retaining of the fixed cost infrastructure?
Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.
Until we see enrollment, we\'re not really going to get too far with assessing what the loss will be. We made estimates off of the current book of business, which by the way turned over almost 55% this last year. We had a certain frame of competitors in each market, which has already changed. More people have left the exchanges since we have. And so until we get a look at what the membership looks like, we\'re not going to really be able to nail the number with any degree of certainty. We certainly did it to reduce fairly dramatically the amount of capital we had at risk and the amount of losses we would sustain. Negative returns on invested capital are not sustainable over the long term and so we tried to reduce both.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. And then maybe just last question. Throughout the year, it sounds like the government businesses made up for the fact that there\'s been pressure on the ACA compliant businesses throughout the year. Are you still able to characterize both Medicaid and Medicare as kind of in your target margin ranges? Would it be fair to say that they\'re now at the higher end of that range? I guess trying to think about directionally could we expect maybe a reversion in the government book next year or are we right where you would expect?
Mark T. Bertolini - Aetna, Inc.
Well, if you look at how we\'ve deployed the health insurance fee change, we have a number of markets that are at the MLR limit, so we were able to give those more in benefits and to preserve margins in the business. But there are only so far you can go. So that should help our growth come January 1. There are other markets where we were not necessarily performing up to oil (56:00) and we had to correct those. But all-in-all what we tried to do was make sure that we weren\'t having to pay rebates that we made sure that we gave those back in benefits to seniors. We preserved margins and we kept as many zero premium plans as possible.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, great. Thanks.
