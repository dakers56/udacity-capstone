Good morning. I\'m Scott Fidel, a managed care analyst with Deutsche Bank. I\'m very pleased to have our first presentation this morning from Aetna. Aetna is one of the largest managed care organizations in the United States, highly diversified. And the company recently just completed the large acquisition in its recent history with the acquisition of Coventry Health Care.
Here today from the company, we have Shawn Guertin who\'s the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The format for today is going to be a Q&A session, so I\'ll be asking questions and certainly I want to solicit questions from the audience as well. But first, I want to introduce Tom Cowhey. Tom heads up Investor Relations to give some initial comments. Thanks.
Thomas F. Cowhey
Good morning, everyone. I\'ve got one slide for you, just the cautionary statement. It basically says that actual future results could differ materially from projections. You should take a look at our SEC filings for additional risk factors as well as that of Coventry related to the first quarter for additional risk factors in there or the 8-K that we filed this morning with the SEC. With that, I think we can get right into the Q&A, and we\'ll take it from there.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. Great. Well, I know that exchanges have dominated the conversations recently. But before we do get into the exchanges, given that you\'ve -- Aetna did just complete a very significant acquisition with Coventry, John, I just wanted to first just to get an update from you on how the initial integration is proceeding with Coventry. And again, just walk us through with the meaningful cost synergy opportunities that the company has, sort of how the first phase of that is proceeding.
Shawn M. Guertin
Okay, great. Good morning, everyone. So in terms of the closing and then the integration, what I can say is one of the nice things about having a protracted regulatory approval process is you have lots of time to plan for what you\'re going to do Day 1 when you close, and I think that has served us well, and that we had a pretty robust plan on what we wanted to do right at the outset. Some of those things are just communication things, but a lot of those things are the business aspects of closing, and I can talk about a few of those. So, so far, so good. And candidly, in some ways, the beginning of an integration isn\'t where the heavy lifting is. It\'s when you actually start moving customers around in terms of their relationships or systems, and that works -- excuse me, that work is out in front of us going forward. So that part of it isn\'t going yet, but we don\'t have any service issues or people issues of note right at the outset. So like I said, so far, so good. So we gave some guidance on the synergies for this year that are fairly meaningful. Our overall guidance is for $400 million of synergies. That breaks in general into like 3 big pieces: sort of duplicate -- think about corporate overhead, sort of duplicate expenses. You have fixed cost leverage, basically bringing sort of the Coventry business onto our platform. Obviously, we can eliminate some fixed cost as part of that. And then the third is ultimately the IT overlap, which is we don\'t need as many operating systems long term as you inherit on Day 1. So the first of those is really where you start to sort of make up the most synergies at the beginning, which is obviously getting rid of the duplicate overhead. You don\'t need 2 external auditors, you don\'t need 2 CEOs, you don\'t need 2 CFOs, things like that. That\'s the easy stuff that you can do at the beginning. The next phase of that is probably the fixed cost leverage, and that\'s where we actually start to sort of integrate operations as it relates to the customer, whether that\'s sales and service relationships, whether that\'s the system that they\'re on. And that probably begins in earnest. I mean, the planning for that goes on now, but a lot of that in earnest probably happens -- starts to happen next year. And really, the final piece sequentially is being able to shut down a bunch of IT systems, and that\'s obviously at the end because you can\'t do that until you\'ve gotten all the customers moved off of those systems. So I think that\'s the flow. The other thing I would say is what\'s not in there, right? We\'re not banking on a lot of revenue synergies or synergies from the PBM arrangement. It really is very much an expense-driven sort of synergies. So when I think about -- and certainly, we\'ve pushed the organization to achieve upside. It certainly could be in the form of trying to exceed synergies, but it would also be in the form for actually able to realize cross-sell synergies on revenue and things like that.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Maybe just talking about one of the more near-term initiatives, just in terms of on the Medicare Advantage bids and just with Coventry. And can you give us any updates on how much integration you\'ve been able to move towards in terms of sort of combining certain products and bid design strategies? Or given the pretty short turnaround time that we have here, are you largely going to keep those 2 strategies relatively discrete for 2014?
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes, I would say one of the nice things about the timing of the close and actually I think one of the smart things that we did during the regulatory approval process was create a clean room. Obviously, looking at competitor pricing is something you can\'t do in that pre-approval period. But what we did is we\'ve designed sort of an information set, and we actually had an external third party gather that so that on Day 1 we weren\'t starting from sort of square one, if you will, in terms of trying to understand how the bids were prepared. So what I would say is, we were able to get at it quicker, what I\'d like to if we had more time, absolutely. But I think we understand the strategies. I think we\'ve been able to shape in some ways, maybe on around the edges sort of a better overall positioning, where we have overlap. So I feel like I have a handle on what\'s out there, what the strategy is. We\'ve been able to adopt it where we think it makes sense. It\'s no substitute for going through the whole process from beginning to end. But I think again, it was one of the benefits of doing that. When you think about the broader year, I mean, I think I\'d said this probably going back to when the preliminary notice came out, it\'s going to be a tough year for MA in 2014. Even with sort of the fix, there\'s a fairly meaningful GAAP, if you will, that you have to solve for if you want to maintain margins. So it is going to be a tough year for MA. I do think we mentioned before that the way you attack this problem is to work first on all of the things that don\'t impact the member value proposition: your own cost structure, your medical cost structure in the form of provider contracting, how you do medical management. Have you really optimized your risk-adjusted revenue? So we spent a lot of time looking for opportunities and thinking about how to do all those things because none of those things will be a detriment to member premium or benefits. To some extent, member premium and benefits is what you solve for at the end. Once you\'ve sort of tapped all these other wells, you\'re sort of down to just being able to move that around. So that -- it\'s tough. I think we have -- I think we have a decent game plan for 2014. I still feel very -- I still feel like the long-term outlook for the product is positive. I actually think if you wanted to read one sign into the sort of the doc fix they put in, to me it wasn\'t as much about it will have an effect on 2014. But the more important thing to me was I think that was a very positive sign about support for this program long term. And I take a lot of encouragement, and I think this is still going to be a good long-term business. We\'ve been preparing for years that we would be reimbursed at around 100% of fee-for-service and trying to design our plans and products to work in that environment. So \'14, to some extent, is just an acceleration down a path that I think we were already on.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
And thinking just about the legacy Aetna MA book and given the business mix is a bit different than much of the industry in terms of being way more weighted towards group products. Clearly, the bids are going to be due in just a few days so I\'m assuming that you\'ve been having some conversations and interactions with your group customers. And maybe if you could give us an update on that and in terms of how much flexibility you\'ve found in those discussions to be able to possibly restructure some of the premiums and cost sharings and benefit designs with those group accounts. Maybe give us an update on whether you\'ve been able to find more flexibility on the group side or does it seem like it\'s tracking the process pretty similar to what we\'re off, thinking about any individual MA side.
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes, it\'s a -- what I would say is, having the group account and in essence, having a third-party in the equation in the form of an employer, certainly gives us more flexibility. The group benefits tend to be very rich as well so like there\'s more probably more room there. But having said that, that\'s still money coming out of someone\'s pocket. And so it is not a silver bullet. I\'d rather have the flexibility than not have the flexibility. And I would say to some extent, having that flexibility has helped on an account-by-account basis. But it\'s still -- Scott, to your question on the continuum is probably still closer to the individual MA challenged than it is just sort of having no challenge at all.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
[indiscernible] for any kind of traditional FX but then also how much capital required is [indiscernible] grow [indiscernible] additional insurance [indiscernible] generate more free cash flow [indiscernible] former and the latter.
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes. Maybe new, but you have made a very perceptive point already. Because I do think one of the things that people often under-appreciate about this business is how incredibly cash rich a business it is compared -- especially compared to other businesses. And we\'ve tried to bring that out a little bit more, if you look at our releases, by showing an adjusted operating EPS, which backs out like dealer amortization. But so there is a lot of positive cash flow there, and the cash flow yields are very attractive. I\'ll go back to the CapEx question. A simple rule of thumb is -- let me back up. So when you sitting at the company, the first -- one of the first things you have to decide when you think about your capital structure is what\'s the rating profile that I want from A.M. Best, and from Moody\'s and S&P and folks like that. That usually is driven by 2 decisions, which is how much do I want to capitalize my regulated subsidiaries and how much debt do I want to take on the balance sheet? So we want to be an A-rated company from A.M. Best, and as part of that decision, we have been funding our subsidiaries at around what we\'ve called 300% of risk-based capital. A rough rule of thumb on that would be 20% of premium. So for every dollar of premium that we grow, we need to retain 20% of that back in to regulate subs. Now on the margin, as we\'ve talked about as part of the Coventry deal, we\'ll be moving from 300 to 275, so -- and you can just do the math, 275 or 300 x 20, you\'re probably up in the high teens now. And when you look -- again when you look at the returns on statutory capital in this business, they are very, very attractive. So in essence, our best use of capital is actually funding organic growth because that is where we get the highest return on capital, and to some extent, that\'s our first preference. CapEx has actually become -- sort of CapEx availability I think has actually become a bit bigger factor in this industry over time whether it\'s ICD-10, which started this in health care reform, and so that actually has led to a lot of smaller and maybe single site providers to say, "Enough, I can\'t." For example, if it costs me x to make my system ICD-10-compliant, it might cost somebody who\'s a 1/10 of my size the same amount, right?. And so that\'s one of the benefits of size, right, is some of these fixed cost expenses. So the capital intensity has increased, and I think what that has done in the business is it\'s crowded out a little bit of other CapEx spending that you might have done on other things just because there\'s been so much spending on health care reform readiness, ICD-10 and you\'re always trying to sort of balance this out. There\'s always something coming down the horizon, right? But it feels like we\'re on the backside of that issue right now than on the front side. So capital, the thing about this business that I would say is interesting is that capital is not an issue, right. That is really not, not our issue in terms of if we had -- if we needed to spend x on CapEx, we can fund x. If we need to fund organic growth, we can fund organic growth. So from that perspective, it\'s not capital intense in sort of in that scenario, the risk-based capital is a meaningful amount of capital, obviously, and the subs and so from that perspective, it is intense. But as an operating prob -- it\'s not an operating -- a big operating issue to us. The other thing or the last thing I would say is, I think my predecessor in this role did an absolutely fabulous job of, I think, probably making the most capital-efficient company in this space with some of the creative things that he put in place, and it would be my intention to sort of keep writing the coattails of that and maybe tweaking and improving those going forward. I think there is some really amazing work that he did, and frankly, we\'re still probably the only company in this space to sort of use some of those tools.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Great. I wanted to just -- just taking [ph] on the MA topic for a moment and shifting over to the Coventry platform and a bit more of the classic profile there in terms of a higher mix of individual business. But one thing that Coventry does have is a pretty meaningful component of PPO business. And Shawn, maybe, can you talk a bit about as you look at the Coventry product positioning into the evolving reimbursement environment, that MA spacing in 2014 and 2015? Your thoughts on it\'s current positioning and whether you see some adjustments being made to that or whether you feel like the geographic and product mix for the legacy Coventry MA business is at the place that is meant to be right now.
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes, I think that\'s largely -- it largely is. I mean, we\'re always pushing to sort of expand our footprint for a couple of reasons. The one -- the most direct one being just grow and continuing to have more places to sort of grow the individual business. A bigger footprint also is very helpful on the group business as well. So we will continue to push for expansion in that business. I think one of the things that was nice to inherit specific to 2014 from Coventry was they were -- they weren\'t the biggest. They were second to Humana in terms of increasing star ratings. And so that actually when you think about how to solve the problem, there was some nice feeling of the gap, if you will, because you know you\'re going to get a revenue lift from star ratings there. So that was one of the nice aspects of that business. In terms of their PPO business, to be clear, it\'s not the regional -- this is still a local market type business. It\'s not sort of the broad multi-jurisdiction kind of regional PPO business that I think some people have been concerned with. So there\'s always more to do on sort of the product portfolio and in particular, how you deliver value to the consumer, and that stuff will continue to go on. But in general, I think they have sort of the right sort of framework for the future there.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
And in terms of levers to pull specifically and thinking about the distribution channel, do you feel like there\'s still some capacity there to potentially look to revise down or rationalize some of the commission streams in the MA side of the business as you\'re dealing with the reimbursement pressures?
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes, I do. I mean, again, no one of the things is a silver bullet. But again, that\'s a process that you have to go through sort of market by market and thinking about filling the gap. And so it\'s not something where you\'re likely to take dramatic action unless you\'re in a dramatic circumstance. But there clearly is some opportunity at times to do that. And if your outlook is that a product is going to produce a certain level of profitability, your acquisition expense has to bear some kind of return relationship to that as well, and you\'ve got to make sure that still holds going forward.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay, great. So given that all my MA questions probably seem so far 2 months ago, maybe we\'ll switch over to the topic du jour, which is clearly the exchanges now. And maybe Shawn, just to sort of set the table here, I think it will be helpful for folks to understand just as Aetna is evaluating the different markets, some of the key selection criteria that the company uses in evaluating whether to play or not to play in particular exchange markets.
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes. I think if there is a single kind of pass/fail criteria and thinking about an exchange market, it\'s whether you have the cost structure to really win and/or protect yourself in terms of being able to manage care. And so what\'s sort of obvious, but that starts with a fundamental belief that these are going to be very price-driven markets. And therefore, you need a cost structure to drive sort of the price for success. There might be some other reasons you might take a different strategy. But in general, if you don\'t have the cost structure to succeed, it\'s a much higher bar in terms of deciding whether I would go in and play at a higher price point or not. So that\'s a big deal. And those cost structures are generally taking the form of much narrower provider networks, high-performance networks, accountable care organizations and things like that. It varies across the country, but that\'s a big issue. The next one is and then probably thinking about the demographics of the market, with maybe a particular focus on the population that would be eligible for subsidies in each of these markets and where are they now? Are those members uninsured? Are those members in small employers? And so I think as a general rule, targeting markets that have higher proportions of subsidy-eligible people, not only would you think would lead to sort of greater volume but at the beginning, that might get you a better spread of risk as well because in general, the more people who participate, the more risk spread we get and we\'re probably better off as a result of that. So there\'s a risk-management aspect to that as well. Interestingly enough, where you are today has some relevance, and probably the most relevant aspect of it is your ability to get a cost structure. But it\'s not necessarily if I was in a market today but frankly didn\'t have the cost structure to win. Again you\'re back to that sort of high bars. So you\'d be there. And then you\'d get into softer stuff: what\'s the regulatory environment like? Do you think you can sort of maintain adequate rates over time? What\'s the competitive environment like? Is this a market that\'s going to have 15 players or 10 players in it, and thus that decreases my chance to sort of win and get good risk spread compared to some market that maybe 3 or 4 people are playing in and I have a better chance of winning and a better chance to get spread risks. So it\'s an art, really, not a science. So I would say that generally describes the thought process sort of going in.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Great. Well, that\'s a great framework. And maybe thinking about those criteria in that framework and now bringing it down to one single market and, obviously, some of the recent news was around California, the Covered California individual program where Aetna chose not to participate and it wasn\'t alone in that, where all 3 of the national NCOs -- United, Aetna and Signal -- all chose not to participate in. Maybe sort of juxtaposing that with these criteria that you just discussed, maybe talk about Aetna\'s decision to not participate in California. And then just focusing a little on the regulatory environment aspect of that, because the Covered California process was a bit different than what we\'ve the been seeing in other states. It was a closed process. It was one where it felt like the regulators were much more intensively involved in the rate development process than we probably saw in the other markets. So how much of those factors were also, I guess, influencing your decision not to initially at least play in the Covered California market?
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes. And let me be clear. In many ways, this is a decision that is specific to Aetna and significant to Aetna\'s individual business. We\'re very committed to the California market, and Medicare product there, have a small group and large, significant large product there. So this a much more focused issue. Clearly, from a market opportunity and to some extent, demographics, it\'s an attractive market, right? But I think the combination of not feeling that we could really bring a winning cost structure to the market starts sort of beg some risk-management questions. You might hang around the market for some reasons where you didn\'t maybe have that at Day 1 and price cautiously. But from a risk management perspective, California is so big. It\'s not -- in mind that if you\'re going to be prudent about how you play in this, it\'s not a market where you sort of go in there and sort of be wondering about, do I have the cost structure model to succeed? So part of that is we just didn\'t think we had gotten across that bridge. Clearly, part of this whole thing, broadly on exchanges, is if you do go in and if your pricing is a little bit behind or even breakeven, you have to believe that you can work your way out of that position going forward. And that\'s were the regulatory dynamic comes in, and certainly, bigger people than us have in California have had difficulty at times getting into rates that they thought were adequate. So again, is it a determining factor in isolation? No. It\'s more of the combination sort of, do we really think we can win there sort of long-term? We just don\'t see that path right now. But again, this has a lot more to go, I think, with our position there today and sort of our view on how to approach the exchange markets than it does some systemic issue about California.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
I just want to check if there\'s any questions in the audience. Okay. Well, I\'ll continue through. And maybe talking a bit about some of the more employer sponsor market dynamics, which is still by far the brunt of your business. And clearly, one of the topics that\'s been in focus and is the ongoing shift to self funding to ASO that we\'ve been seeing in the marketplace. A lot of discussion around how this influences 2014 because of maybe some of the ACA influencing factors. But I thought it was interesting that we\'ve actually seen an acceleration even in 2013 in this. And again, this is a 10-year secular trend we\'ve seen, but it was interesting in the first quarter virtually every commercial MCO beat my ASO enrollment forecast and missed on fully insured. So that process in terms of mix shift is clearly already playing out. So maybe give us an update on your thoughts about the velocity of this trend and whether you expect that to accelerate into 2014. And then, clearly, a lot of the focus right now is on the movement downstream in terms of middle-market employers and some of the smaller employers now more actively considering this option.
Shawn M. Guertin
Yes, I think that the one thing I would say that I think is the other dynamic about risk in ASC is, I think, broadly, that I think people, you see that people have been cautious, I think, around their commercial risk pricing as well. And I think that there\'s a lot of reasons for that. So I think the other dynamic that\'s been causing people to sort of miss estimates and shrink even on commercial risk also has to do with just frankly pricing posture that a lot of the publicly traded companies are taking going into 2014. But Scott\'s right. This has been an omnipresent trend in this business for almost as long as I\'ve been in it. And I think whether it\'s to help ensure the sort of some of the plan requirements, I think about this as weights on a scale. Those are more weights on the scale that are going to push people to self funding. And so when you think about the rate of change, it\'s by definition, you would think that, that would accelerate a little bit now. The thing I would keep in mind is, this has been going on a long time. And so there\'s a lot of people who are fully insured for a reason. This option has been out there, and they\'ve sort of discounted it. Scott\'s point again is valid. Maybe this is the tipping factor for them. I think it is reasonable that self-funding is going to move down market. We have constructed a product set to be able to offer that to smaller employers. And again, I think there are, as an employer, there are some watch-outs in making that choice to self fund your benefit plan. But again, I do think it\'s a trend that we will see given the exchanges. And I think we\'ve tried to prepare for it. The small group market in particular is tricky because, again, they have sort of a multitude of options, including letting their people go to the public exchange probably a little bit more readily than maybe larger employers do. And whether or not that will ultimately turn out to be a more attractive choice to them, we\'ll see. The thing that could go the other way here is the whole notion of private exchanges. Maybe it could be for small employers, but we\'ve sort of talked about it more in the construct of large employers. And there is an opportunity here to convert what used to be ASC lives back into insured lives. And the profit dynamics of that around both of these trends is it\'s probably an uninsured member is probably 4 to 5x as profitable as an ASC member. They\'re different risk profile in that sort of makes it happen. But that\'s a counter trend that I actually think it\'s an important enough trend, it\'s one of the more important trends that we need to be ready for and frankly take advantage of. I think there\'s a lot of factors and there\'s a lot of employers certainly talking about going to a defined contribution approach. Again, I said to Scott at breakfast we\'re great in this industry at defining the trends, but we almost always tend to sort of overestimate how quickly they happen. And this might be one, right, where there\'s a lot of talk right now, and when the rubber meets the road, I\'m not sure how many employers will pull the trigger on moving to private exchanges. But I think there\'s an awful lot of logic there. So that\'s one. What I think about this whole exchange strategy is, when I think about public exchanges it\'s largely an optionality value for our company and that we have less than 10% of our EBITDA coming from there. And I want to be clear on public with some things we said. If it\'s an option, you have to participate. And so it\'s not about being out there and not getting any members. You have to pick and choose your spots prudently and earn your cost of capital and all of that, but you do want to sort of participate there. So I think -- and then on the private side, I think, thinking about how to participate in some of the broker-driver exchanges, like Aon Hewitt, but maybe even thinking about a proprietary exchange maybe that you would build for an industry vertical. It would be sort of the kinds of things of that we\'ve talked about. And I think that\'s the way I see sort of both sides of this. I do think this is a very important trend in this business and one that\'s going to continue to sort of increase the role of the consumer and the buying process.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Scott [ph], Do you have a question?
Unknown Analyst
Yes. Two questions. First, a follow-up on your comments about California, and maybe if you could elaborate a little more what you meant questioning the ability to bring a winning cost structure to the exchange. Your company has had a big focus on ACOs and a lot of markets. Why couldn\'t you just build in some ACOs there in those types of narrower networks? Was it a lack of starting point membership or some other factor? And then my second question is how you think about -- you said you\'re committed to the small group market in California. How do you think about how much of that would switch into the exchanges where you won\'t be participating in? And just broadly, you\'re current view about the pace of small groups switching to the exchanges.
Shawn M. Guertin
On the first one, again, it\'s really multiple factors, so I don\'t want to overplay the regulatory environment versus cost structure versus this versus that. But you\'re right. I mean, there are many instances, not just California, where we had good discussions with providers leading up to this, but frankly weren\'t able to sort of get across the finish line on thinking we had whether it\'s a narrow network or an accountable care type of product. And so again, it was just that one factor that we consider there. We certainly have the footprint. We have 60,000 individual members in California today. So there certainly was enough to work off of it in terms of there. But again, the multitude of factors just didn\'t play out there. On small employer, it\'s not our view today that there will be a big rush of small employers into the shop type exchanges. And I think that the rate at which small employers maybe go, either go into the shop but maybe more importantly, try to get their employees into the public exchange, we\'ll go back to my subsidy comment. There are different sort of socioeconomic demographics about the small employer workforce and sort of the level of income they have and sort of whether they qualify for subsidy. I would expect that the dynamic there would be the more subsidy eligible, the more those people ultimately would end up in a public exchange. Again, the pace of this, though, probably isn\'t rapid. Certainly in \'14, I don\'t think it will be rapid. But over time, it will be more like a trend.
Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. great. With that, I think we\'re out of time. So I want to thank Aetna very much. Thank you.
Shawn M. Guertin
