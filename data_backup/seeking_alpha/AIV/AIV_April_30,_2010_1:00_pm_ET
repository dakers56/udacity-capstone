Welcome to the first quarter 2010 Apartment Investment and Management Co. earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) Now, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to turn the call over to Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Council.
Lisa Cohn
Good morning and good afternoon. During the conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management\xe2\x80\x99s judgment including projections related to 2010 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.
Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on AIMCO\xe2\x80\x99s website. 
Participants on today\xe2\x80\x99s call will be Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO who will provide opening remarks, Tim Beaudin, AIMCO\xe2\x80\x99s President and Chief Operation officer will speak to property operations, redevelopment activities and asset sales, Ernie Freedman our CFO who will review first quarter financial results, debt capital market activity and guidance for the second quarter and full year 2010.
I will now turn the call to Terry Considine, our CEO.
Terry Considine
Thank you, Lisa and thanks to all of you on this call for your interest in AIMCO. The focus of this call will be AIMCO\xe2\x80\x99s first quarter results, but before turning the call over to my colleagues, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to offer some general observations.
First, this is a good time to invest in apartments. Supply and demand fundamentals are quite good with net new supply barely positive over the next five years, while demand is highly predictable and growing.
The number of men and women aged 24 will increase by four million or 6% over the next five years. Most of these will live in apartments at one time or another and as a result, demand for rental apartments is projected to increase by almost a million units and the predictable result will be rent increases.
The second reason to invest in apartments is that apartments are real or hard assets, and while I recognize that there\xe2\x80\x99s current measured inflation, there is widespread concern that the enormous increase in money supply and financial liquidity can translate into monetary inflation, and if so, apartments are likely to hold their real value.
So this is a good time to invest in apartments and it\xe2\x80\x99s an even better time to invest in AIMCO. We have a simple business plan. We own and operate about 100,000 apartments, primarily BB+ in quality. Our properties are generally located in the top 20 U.S. markets. 
Besides owning and operating apartments, we also create value by redeveloping opportunistically, and we finance at the property level with low risk, non-recourse, long dated fixed rate and amortizing property debt that provides a low cost of capital and an interesting hedge against inflation.
It seems to me that the AIMCO share price stands to benefit more than the share prices of other apartment REIT\xe2\x80\x99s. As the apartment market recovers and as the stock market understands more clearly six key valuation factors.
First, we hold high quality assets. Second, we\xe2\x80\x99re a reliable operator. Third, we have limited balance sheet risk. Fourth, we have a high quality of earnings. Fifth, our shares are priced at a discount to the shares of apartment REIT peers. And sixth, the financial leverage of our high quality non-recourse property debt and preferred stocks magnifies the upside in a rising market.
With that, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to turn the call to Tim Beaudin to review operations.
Timothy Beaudin
On today\xe2\x80\x99s call, I will discuss our first quarter operating results, provide some color around what we see heading into leasing season and finally, provide a brief update on what we are seeing on the capital recycling front.
First, operating results. AIMCO\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio primarily consists of same store properties and redevelopment properties with 80% of the NOI coming from same store and 15% provided by redevelopment. The remaining 5% of our NOI is generated by other conventional properties. The portfolio NOI was down 2% in the first quarter compared to first quarter last year. A total same store NOI decline of 4.3% was somewhat offset by gains in redevelopment.  
Our same store properties are comprised of conventional same store and affordable same store. Conventional same store NOI was down 5.4% compared to the first quarter 2009, 10 basis points better than the high end of our guidance provided last quarter. Conventional same store revenue declined 1.8% driven by a 5.5% decline in average rents, partially offset by 2.7% increase in occupancy to 96%.
Lower rates were further offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of more than 22% and a 3.6% increase in other rental income served to offset the decline in average rent.
Conventional same store expenses increased 3.9% primarily due to increased snow removal costs in the Northeast, repairs and maintenance and marketing expenses partially offset by lower churn costs and administrative expenses.
Affordable same store NOI was 3.2% higher compared to first quarter 2009 with revenues up 2.9% and expenses up 2.7%. While this is just 11% of AIMCO\xe2\x80\x99s NOI, our allocation to affordable properties serves to offset the volatility of our conventional portfolio, provide revenue growth that over time is similar to that of the conventional properties, expand our investment opportunities and provide helpful positioning with government bodies benefiting AIMCO\xe2\x80\x99s business overall.
Conventional redevelopment NOI was up 14.6% compared to the first quarter of 2009 while affordable redevelopment NOI was up 10.2%. NOI gains in the redevelopment are primarily a function of lease up of units that were offline a year ago.
As we head into leasing season, we are cautiously optimistic for several reasons; first, we have had a great deal of success in retaining our residents. During the first quarter 2010 we retained 68% of our customers, which is up 120 basis points over first quarter 2009 and represents an all time high for AIMCO.
Second, our apartments are full. First quarter 2010 occupancy was 96% overall and north of 95% in nearly all of our markets. April average daily occupancy is holding steady and demand remains healthy.
Third, the decline in transacted rents seems to be slowing. For the quarter, conventional same store new lease rents were 7% lower than the expiring lease rates, while renewal rates were 10 basis points higher than the expiring lease rates.
Since the beginning of the year, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to increase conventional same store new lease rents month over month in the majority of our markets with southern California and Florida being notable exceptions.
We saw new and renewal lease rates improve throughout the quarter and the gap between new and renewal rates has narrowed a negative 5.5% during the fourth quarter to a negative 3% for the first quarter of 2010.
While we have not seen a robust recovery, we are encouraged to see signs of improvement and we will see what the next few months bring. 
As to our capital recycling, our strategy is to sell 5% to 10% of our portfolio annually with proceeds generally used to improve portfolio quality through redevelopment or acquisitions within our target markets. However, sales volumes in any given quarter or year will be dependent on the availability of attractive opportunities to redeploy capital.
We are still very focused on repaying the $35 million of our term debt, so proceeds from asset sales will be used primarily for that purpose until the balance is fully paid. During the first quarter we sold 12 properties for $83 million with net proceeds to AIMCO of $17 million. 
We currently have five commercial properties under contract with hard money that are expected to close within the next 30 days or so and about a dozen affordable properties that we expect to close during the second half of the year.
We have more than 20 conventional properties that are listed in some stage of negotiation or under contract and nearly twice that amount in affordable properties in similar stages of marketing.
We are seeing strong buyer interest in the properties we are selling with multiple offers on every property. Cap rates are dropping and pricing is improving in virtually every market when compared to last year, parts of Florida being the exception. But prices remain well below peak levels due to lower projected NOI\xe2\x80\x99s.
In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter results and our plans for the future remain simple and unchanged. We are going to focus on creating our portfolio well and continuing to improve portfolio quality and concentrating capital in our target markets.
With that, I will turn it over to Ernie.
Ernest Freedman
On today\xe2\x80\x99s call I will cover the following subjects; first, our financial results for the first quarter, second, our balance sheet, and third, I will provide second quarter and full year 2010 guidance.
Before I discuss our results, I would like to point out that we have made a number of changes to our earning release and supplemental schedules for 2010, which we hope you will find to be improvements. As you spend time reviewing our supplemental schedules and have any questions or feedback, please reach out to Luke Coleson or me.
Now for our first quarter financial results. First quarter pro forma FFO was $0.32 per share, $0.02 per share above the high point of guidance provided in February. Higher than anticipated occupancy in our redevelopment portfolio and lower offsite costs were partially offset by lower than expected transaction income. Variances in offsite costs and transaction income are the result of timing, partially offset by lower [inaudible] over three quarters.
Turning to the balance sheet, we retained $55 million of our term debt in 2010 including $10 million in April, leaving us with a balance of $35 million today. We expect that this will be fully repaid from property sale proceeds over the next few months. We have no 2010 property debt maturities and we currently have four loans with appropriate collateral totaling $100 million that mature in 2011.
We plan to refinance these loans closer to the expected maturity dates, but we will continue to work with our lending partners to seek an earlier refinance if possible. We continue to focus on loan maturities occurring during 2012 through 2014 looking to extend our loans beyond that period to reduce refunding risks and lock in current interest rates.
As we look past the next few years of projected economic growth, we plan to reduce somewhat AIMCO financial leverage both by physical recovery of property income and by scheduled amortization of our property debt, which averages about $80 million per year over the next few years.
Now to guidance, second quarter 2010 pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.28 to $0.34 per share with year over year same store NOI decline of 5% to 6%. On April 1, two properties were moved into our conventional same store portfolio from the conventional redevelopment portfolio.  Our second quarter 2010 conventional same store NOI guidance includes the reclassification of these properties.
Projected full year 2010 pro forma FFO is unchanged from our last update and is expected to range from $1.25 to $1.35 per share. Our projection of full year conventional same store NOI decline at 2% to 5% below our total portfolio NOI decline of 1% to 3% also remains unchanged.
With that, we will now open the call up for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue.

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Michelle Ko \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America.
Michelle Ko \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America
I was just wondering, given the positive commentary of some of your peers over the last couple of days, we were somewhat surprised that you weren\xe2\x80\x99t more enthusiastic and didn\xe2\x80\x99t increase your 2010 same store guidance. I was just wondering does this pertain because of AIV\xe2\x80\x99s lower price points, which might not be as volatile as some of the higher price points and you might not see an upside during the recovery?
Ernest Freedman
First, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to point out that we were pleased with how we came out in the first quarter. We did perform a little bit better than guidance range. And I\xe2\x80\x99d also point out when you look at the ranges of many of the companies put out at the beginning of the year, we were at the higher end of those ranges, so we feel very comfortable we kept our guidance at that point.
So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it as a view of we\xe2\x80\x99re not enthusiastic. We talked about where we think the market is and how it\xe2\x80\x99s performing. We feel very comfortable we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to perform within the ranges that we\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out for the rest of the year.
Michelle Ko \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America
Could you also comment on which markets you think are deteriorating or recovering faster than what you had expected and which markets you might see job growth come back first?
Tony D\xe2\x80\x99Alto
The good news is that we\xe2\x80\x99re basically seeing recovery across most markets. It\xe2\x80\x99s relative of course in places like Phoenix and Miami, less so relative to rate increases, but are doing fairly well. I\xe2\x80\x99d point out that we only have two markets in our entire portfolio that\xe2\x80\x99s below 95%.
So I think that the coasts of course, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the Northeast and southern California and pretty much everyplace outside of Phoenix and Florida where we\xe2\x80\x99re very highly occupied and we\xe2\x80\x99re taking rate increases through the first quarter and we feel very comfortable that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be pretty well set up for the summer season. So in total, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing it across the board. It\xe2\x80\x99s just relative levels of strength depending on the market.
Michelle Ko \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America
When do you expect to see same store revenue growth year over year and also sequentially?
Ernest Freedman
Based on the guidance numbers that we guided for the second quarter and doing the math for the second half of the year, there is a possibility within our guidance range that we could see that coming up in the second half of the year. Sequentially, we did see revenue growth from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Year over year I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll be seeing some time based on the math, a possibility to see that in the second half of the year.
Operator
You\'re next question comes from Jonathan Habermann \xe2\x80\x93 Goldman Sachs.
Jonathan Habermann \xe2\x80\x93 Goldman Sachs
Just going back to the difference between the performances of A\xe2\x80\x99s and B\xe2\x80\x99s and Terry, you made reference obviously to AIMCO and compared the company to some of your peers, but I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, as you\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to see the cap rates widen out between A\xe2\x80\x99s and B\xe2\x80\x99s, do you feel that the expectations for rent growth from the more class A assets are just getting too high at this point in terms of growth over the next two or three years?
Terry Considine
I think that the asset pricing is more optimistic than the data providers\xe2\x80\x99 rent projections, and that gives rise to which of the two is right. It could be that rates will grow faster, that rental rates will grow faster, and if so, that will be because of real demand recovery in the job markets in this time of very limited supply, or it will be because of inflation, creeping into monetary inflation creeping into the economy. For the moment, I think we have to wait and see.
Jonathan Habermann \xe2\x80\x93 Goldman Sachs
The reason I ask is that I think about AIMCO, you referenced at your analyst day that markets such as New York and Boston and San Francisco, you have below average rents versus the market. Do you expect your portfolio to maintain the same rent growth as that of your peers, similarly positioned in those markets?
Terry Considine
I think in those markets, benchmarking against the market, we expect rent growth to be comparable to, or similar to that of the market. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go through and benchmark against a specific peer without looking at the properties.
Jonathan Habermann \xe2\x80\x93 Goldman Sachs
The question on asset sales, can you give us a sense of the dollar amount that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at? You mentioned the number of properties, but what potential dollar amount you currently have listed today and in contrast, what are you looking at in terms of acquisition opportunities and the spread between where you\xe2\x80\x99re selling and where you potentially would be buying.
Terry Considine
We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in today\xe2\x80\x99s guidance; I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall whether we gave guidance to it, but that we would sell probably $300 million in assets and generate $100 million in cash for corporate purposes, primarily the repayment of the term debt. And that\xe2\x80\x99s well underway as Tim mentioned in his remarks.
Going forward, further sales will be connected to our opportunities on an accretive basis either in acquisitions or redevelopment and in looking at that, we don\xe2\x80\x99t focus as much on NOI cap rates or NOI differences as we do on free cash flow, internal rates of return and we would expect that they would be accretive and not dilutive.
Jonathan Habermann \xe2\x80\x93 Goldman Sachs
But you talked about asset sales being offset by acquisitions. It sounds like perhaps that could be shifting toward redevelopment. Is that still the direction you\xe2\x80\x99re moving?
Terry Considine
We\xe2\x80\x99re looking at both. It just really goes back to your first question. Some acquisitions are priced at a level that\xe2\x80\x99s not attractive to us and that will lead us to more value added activities like redevelopment. We will require a higher spread than would be available from the acquisition activity.
But we\xe2\x80\x99re also seeing some interesting acquisition opportunities and we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to have to play them out and see which of those we do.
Operator
You\'re next question comes from Jeffrey Donnelly \xe2\x80\x93 Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey Donnelly \xe2\x80\x93 Wells Fargo
Can you talk a little bit about what\xe2\x80\x99s happened subsequent to quarter end? Have you seen revenues? Have you seen trends retreat, hold or accelerate?
Terry Considine
\n', b'
We\xe2\x80\x99re actually holding quite well. As a matter of fact, April will have higher occupancy than March and in terms of revenues, we\xe2\x80\x99re right where we anticipated we\xe2\x80\x99d be.
Jeffrey Donnelly \xe2\x80\x93 Wells Fargo
Does the continued improvement in occupancy lead you to think that maybe you ought to be getting more aggressive on rents sooner?
Terry Considine
\n', b'
We\xe2\x80\x99ve actually been taking rate action and obviously increased occupancies will give us more opportunity to do more of that as we move forward.
Jeffrey Donnelly \xe2\x80\x93 Wells Fargo
On the expense side, we have the revenue certainly coming back. How do you think about your expenses as we roll forward into 2010 and 2011? Is there anything that stands out to you as an area that could come back a little quicker?
Tony D\xe2\x80\x99Alto
We remain very focuses on expenses and as you could see from our reporting, the major material impact in our increase was based on weather. Everything else was a function of timing or some other expenditures in different markets. We expect to be right within what we planned to be, which is baked into our guidance.
Jeffrey Donnelly \xe2\x80\x93 Wells Fargo
You write yourself as a B, B plus owner of apartments, but by the definition I think you published, where your rents stand versus competitors would actually put you something closer to a B minus if you will. But if the goal is to move towards that B plus, I suspect that means selling out more assets. Is there a seam to where the majority of those assets, the ones that might drag you down a little bit, where they reside geographically?
Ernest Freedman
You\xe2\x80\x99re right that we\xe2\x80\x99re always culling our portfolio looking to sell off the bottom, and that should continue to improve our rent to market averages. The fourth quarter reported in our most recent supplemental here that we\xe2\x80\x99re about 103% of local market averages. In our view, we view a B asset somewhere between 90 and 125. So over time, you would expect the 103% to continue to improve, maybe get closer to 105% to 110%. 
In terms of where those assets are, they\xe2\x80\x99re generally located in our non target markets. So we do continue to focus our sales efforts on the bottom of the portfolio as well as our non target markets to improve our standing against local market averages.
Jeffrey Donnelly \xe2\x80\x93 Wells Fargo
I would think that in your target markets, some of the larger urban markets that the gap between the high end of the market and the low end of the market in rent would be fairly wide, so the point being is that you could very easily below the mean in that market but still have pretty high rents in absolute terms. But in a more secondary market, I guess I would assume that the gap3 between high and low rent would be pretty tight, so it would be easy to be at the mean or above, if that logic makes sense. The question is, is there a chance that if you exit secondary markets you actually solidify your position as a more B minus portfolio?
Terry Considine
Based on our numbers that we presented at our investor day, our non target markets are right on top of local market averages at about 100% to 101%. At investor day we reported that we were at 104% for the entire portfolio, so at least with our specific assets, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case.
In theory it could potentially work out for someone else\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio. Possibly. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be the case for our portfolio.
Operator
You\'re next question comes from Michael Levy \xe2\x80\x93 Macquarie Research.
Michael Levy \xe2\x80\x93 Macquarie Research
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the strategy with the term loan. If the capital markets are as open as they seem, and the assets that you may sell to pay off the term loan is generating decent cash flow, and the loan isn\xe2\x80\x99t due for another year and presumably prices are going to do nothing but continue to rise, or at least for the assets that you\xe2\x80\x99re selling, why sell now? Why not just wait until later in the year when pricing is better and sell them?
Terry Considine
Our policy is not to have recourse debt and the term loan was an exception to that. It was a mistake on my part. I just want to get rid of it. It will be paid off in the next month or two or three, and at that point we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a very low cost, very long and attractive debt.
Michael Levy \xe2\x80\x93 Macquarie Research
Obviously rents seem to be rising. I was wondering if you have seen any slowdown in rental rates in the past couple of weeks and the pace at which rents seem to be rising.
Terry Considine
No.
Michael Levy \xe2\x80\x93 Macquarie Research
At the investor day about 10 weeks ago, Ernie mentioned that he thought an appropriate NAV was around $20.00 I think. With that in mind, and given the share price, do you have any view about an equity offering and what you might use the proceeds for?
Ernest Freedman
That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the right point. What is the use of proceeds? Specific to the NAV discussion we had at investor day, we presented an NAV based on September 31 where we thought values were  and I think most people think, talk on the street is that values could be up 5% at year end. So that being the case, and doing the math, our NAV would be plus or minus $3.00 higher than where we were before.
That said, you raise a key point, is use of proceeds. I think the answer is, there\xe2\x80\x99s an attractive use of proceeds and if it makes the most sense for our shareholders, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be dilutive we would definitely consider equity.
Michael Levy \xe2\x80\x93 Macquarie Research
Are you looking at assets to acquire? I think you sort of touched on this earlier, but are you, has there been anything that has come to market for which you would possibly bit?
Terry Considine
Generally we have seen the assets that have come to market and have had the opportunity to bid. We are looking at possible acquisitions, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how they turn out. Most likely, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be funded by proceeds from the sales of our lower rated assets so that in terms of acquisition volumes, if we were to acquire a $300 million of assets, that would be funded by $300 million of sales of lower rated properties currently within our portfolio.
Michael Levy \xe2\x80\x93 Macquarie Research
I know that obviously it seems that there\xe2\x80\x99s more class A assets that are coming onto market and the bidding process for those is intensely competitive, but in past conversations I think you had mentioned that you might be looking at something not in the class A area. So are you seeing opportunities in the class B plus or A minus in areas and is the acquisition environment as competitive in that section or in that corner of the market?
Ernest Freedman
You\xe2\x80\x99re making a very good point. There\xe2\x80\x99s a certain amount of histrionics that gets into these calls. Every part of the business is competitive and whether it\xe2\x80\x99s true for B assets or A assets or C assets, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s true for value added loans at discounts and so forth. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very efficient, very liquid, very competitive market.
Operator
You\'re next question comes from Eric Wolf \xe2\x80\x93 Citigroup.
Eric Wolf \xe2\x80\x93 Citigroup
Just to piggy back off that equity raise question, if you were to raise today, do you know how much property that you could pre-pay without incurring a penalty?
Ernest Freedman
We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be interested to raise equity to pay off property, which has a weighted average maturity of almost nine years at weighted average cost of sub 6%. That wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be attractive at all.
Eric Wolf \xe2\x80\x93 Citigroup
As far as occupancy, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty high right now. It looks like your expectations for the second quarter is an average of 95.5%. To meet the midpoint of your guidance you\xe2\x80\x99d need to average about 94% for the rest of the year. I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if we can take from that that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be much more aggressive on rate in the back half of the year or if there\xe2\x80\x99s some conservatism built into the guidance.
Ernest Freedman
\n', b'
Providing full year guidance, we\xe2\x80\x99ll like others have done, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at that half way through the year. We\xe2\x80\x99ll reset guidance at that point based on activity and what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing for the rest of the year. We\xe2\x80\x99ll address changing full year guidance at that point.
Eric Wolf \xe2\x80\x93 Citigroup
What do you attribute the record high in renewal rates to? Anecdotally, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen less tenants price shopping? Are they just more comfortable with their jobs. 
Terry Considine
I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a combination. Obviously some of the changes in the economy and consumers are being a little more comfortable and confident. I think we work very hard on service and contacts with our residents. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of initiatives along those lines over the last couple of years. So it\xe2\x80\x99s part of a concerted effort to keep them, and so far it\xe2\x80\x99s been successful.
Operator
You\'re next question comes from Stephen Swett \xe2\x80\x93 Morgan Keegan.
Stephen Swett \xe2\x80\x93 Morgan Keegan
On the question of redevelopments, can you talk to the amount of potential redevelopment product that you still have in the portfolio and just what the status of the tax credits indication business is and how that impacts whether you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for affordable or conventional redevelopments.
Timothy Beaudin
On the redevelopment side, we still have a pretty decent pipeline there. As you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve wound that down to basically finishing up some projects. We\xe2\x80\x99re currently going through with Terry right now somewhere between five and ten that we think makes some good solid economic sense. 
We\xe2\x80\x99re still fairly cautious about seeing what the economy does and everything that goes along with that, but on an annual basis, I\xe2\x80\x99d say you could see us doing, if things get back to some level of normalcy, back to $50 million to $100 million of capital spend on specific redoubts, and if the market improved beyond that, then we\xe2\x80\x99d go an argue with Terry that we ought to do more of it.
So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a big issue with that one about that. It\xe2\x80\x99s just really a matter of timing and getting comfortable with the financing markets. Remember in the past, those things were self financing and that market is a little bit tougher right now.
The second issue you brought up had to do with tax credits, and that continues to be tough from a pricing perspective. The number of people buying the tax credit has dwindled and so the pricing related to that has gone down. Being able to come up with a capital stack that makes those deals make sense is more challenging than it\xe2\x80\x99s been in the past, so we have a couple that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to finish up.
We have some more that we could bring to the market if and when that pricing recovers, and so we\xe2\x80\x99ll just watch it and see what happens, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll work our way through it.
Stephen Swett \xe2\x80\x93 Morgan Keegan
I know in the past you\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly preferred to pay higher cap rates than lower cap rates and your comments on finding better value opportunities, can you talk about where pricing is today. Does it make you look differently at which markets where you might be interested to buy or is it really just trying to find those value add opportunities within those markets?
Terry Considine

Right now I would say we\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of price discovery and trying to get a better understanding of what\xe2\x80\x99s available. Transaction volumes have been relatively limited, and so there\xe2\x80\x99s not a flood of opportunities and some of them are priced at prices we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pay.
We are focusing on the geographies that are in our market allocation policies and so we\xe2\x80\x99d like to increase our weightings to Seattle, to the Bay Area and in some markets we\xe2\x80\x99d like to upgrade our locations, for example, in Boston and New York.
So those are the dynamics. Those are markets that are attractive to other people too, and in trying to find opportunity there, we\xe2\x80\x99re discovering that in many cases, we\xe2\x80\x99ll want to take on some additional element of adding value, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a lease up or construction completion or some other activity that will give us a higher return, or redevelopment from our own portfolio, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the kind of internal discussions we\xe2\x80\x99re having.

Karin Ford \xe2\x80\x93 Keybanc Capital Markets
I just want to see if we could get your updated thoughts on the dividend given now better visibility, better environment, the term loan now down to $35 million, just if you have any updated thoughts there.
Terry Considine
You may remember last quarter we talked about it and we said that over time that the dividend is low relative to our profitability. Our practice has been to set it once a year and the Board sets that and they did at our January meeting so I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to see a change at all in the next few quarters.
Going forward beyond that, there will be a balance between the use of profitability for dividend increases and the reduction of property debt that Ernie mentioned in his remarks and so build in our intermediate term forecast that we reviewed with the Board, earlier this week, we\xe2\x80\x99re expecting to give a priority to property debt reduction.
Karin Ford \xe2\x80\x93 Keybanc Capital Markets
Can you talk about what might be holding back Florida as you\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward?
Timothy Beaudin
Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s not recovering as fast, but there are signs that it is recovering in many of the markets, Orlando being probably the weakest followed by Jacksonville for the last several months. We have fairly high occupancies north of 95% except in Orlando, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very price sensitive because there\xe2\x80\x99s still quite a bit of shadow market and other opportunities for people to find housing outside of rentals. So there\xe2\x80\x99s competition.
I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just going to take some time to work through that, but we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing again sequentially, we\xe2\x80\x99re able to raise rates in most places in Florida as well from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So it\xe2\x80\x99s slower, more painful, but it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of inching along.

Michael Salinsky \xe2\x80\x93 RBC Capital Markets
Just going back to the operations, you gave detail in the press release about leasing trends and the improvement in March. Could you talk about renewal and new leasing rates in April as well to give us a sense of how that\xe2\x80\x99s trending?
Terry Considine
We\xe2\x80\x99re just closing April, but we\xe2\x80\x99re trending forward. We continue to make progress. We\xe2\x80\x99ve made sequential revenue gains. We\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on revenue. The rates themselves are relative. You look at last year, we  had lower occupancies and a little bit higher rates and this year we have both higher occupancies and some rate improvement.
It\xe2\x80\x99s just on a year over year I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve listed new lease rates were down 7% which was significantly less than the fourth quarter which was double digit and we were positive in renewals, so we\xe2\x80\x99re positive in rate and in the percentage of people renewing.
So that trend is continuing and hopefully it will continue. There\xe2\x80\x99s no net gains in the employment picture, so we\xe2\x80\x99re cautiously optimistic.
Michael Salinsky \xe2\x80\x93 RBC Capital Markets
Is it safe to say that April trends have been better than March trends?
Terry Considine
Yes.
Michael Salinsky \xe2\x80\x93 RBC Capital Markets
On the commentary about cap rates dropping right now, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a fairly substantial seller over the past couple of years here. I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious as to why you\xe2\x80\x99re not moving forward with selling some more. I know the acquisition opportunities may not go there, but pricing coming down, the chance to deploy some of the proceeds later in the cycle. Why not take advantage of the over [inaudible] a little bit more?
Terry Considine
First, we are as part of our basic plan, selling in the magnitude of $300 million of assets this year, so to that extent we\xe2\x80\x99re taking advantage of that. We\xe2\x80\x99re selling off the bottom of our portfolio. We\xe2\x80\x99re getting very attractive free cash flow internal rate of return pricing on that.
Second, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about maybe expanding it. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not attracted to selling properties to hold cash with an unclear use of proceeds. And so further sales will be connected to our expected use of proceeds.
Just if I could add to what Tony had to say, sort of a sub text  here that I\xe2\x80\x99d like to clarify and that is, what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in apartment markets as far as rental revenue and pricing, and I just want to be clear.
Our first quarter is up over our fourth quarter. Our February is better than our January. Our March was better than our February. Our April is better than our March. Our renewal rates have gone positive. Our new lease rates, which are negative, are less negative. Things are going in the right direction, and we\xe2\x80\x99re just cautious about getting ahead of ourselves.

I\xe2\x80\x99d like to go back to the equities for a second. Considering the run price stock this year, notwithstanding today\xe2\x80\x99s performance, how does a buy back of the preferred sit into your thought process given the cost of equity somewhere in the high fives in the preferred yielding probably somewhere in the eights.
Terry Considine
\n', b'
Those are exactly the right questions. We\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about them just as you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned. But our thinking about our cost of equity would not be as current. It would be what our expected IRI would be over time, and so when we look at our preferreds, we think we might well refund our Series G at a lower cost, with a new issuance of preferred. But we\xe2\x80\x99re not attracted to issuing common equity to invest in levered equities at returns in our preferred at average 8%.
We think our equity is commanding a higher rate of return as is.

Can you talk about the marketing plan for the conventional and affordable portfolio you mentioned in your prepared remarks? What\xe2\x80\x99s the current marketing strategy on that? Are you packaging them as a group, one off, and if as a group, what\xe2\x80\x99s your sense in the marketplace? Is there a portfolio pre-discount? Any thoughts there?
Timothy Beaudin
We\xe2\x80\x99re just going to do a quick relay here because John Bazzant is sitting here, and John is in charge of national activity for both affordable and conventional, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll let John give you some specifics.
John Bazzant
I would tell you that in general terms we\xe2\x80\x99re marketing properties individually. We\xe2\x80\x99re taking them out through our typical process is to solicit multiple brokers. We will interview and select a broker and based upon their particular qualifications, but generally speaking, particularly on the conventional side, we\xe2\x80\x99re selling on one offs.
We do have a couple of small portfolios on the affordable side right now that have been marketed as such and that are tied up as such right now, but these are not big meaningful portfolios if you will to the bottom line.
Timothy Beaudin
I might add to that, and John alluded to it, but we tend to list properties for sale. We like the option process. In a rising market like we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing right now, with the amount of capital chasing deals, we like the idea of finding out how aggressive people will get in this market, and so almost exclusively, there\xe2\x80\x99s always an exception here or there, we are listing properties and working through the option process.

You\'re next question comes from [Joseph Guigan \xe2\x80\x93 Equity Research]
[Joseph Guigan \xe2\x80\x93 Equity Research]
The unemployment rates are close to what they were at the peak and the apartment business really started to fall in the third quarter of \xe2\x80\x9909, which was later than other industries. You\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times that things are improving sequentially quarter by quarter, but the unemployment rates are near the highs, right and the number of people who are long term unemployed is at records which I think would adversely affect the apartment industry, people moving back home to parents or moving back with friends. So although companies like Intel and Apple have done very well and a lot of companies with international business have done well, your tenants are not the CEO of Intel, right. So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why you think given the regular people in America aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing better that things are getting better for you.
Terry Considine
I think you\xe2\x80\x99re exactly right to point to the high levels of unemployment, the high levels of under-employment, the  high levels of discouraged workers. If you wanted to bring that closer to home, in the real estate business it would also be fair to point out that there\xe2\x80\x99s still a considerable inventory of single family homes to be foreclosed and moved through the process that are being absorbed. 
So those are negative facts. The positive facts are that the demographics are quite strong and the number of youngsters between 21 and 34, which is the primary pool of apartment renters, is a very large number compared to previous age courts. If you look at the number of people that were born in 1980 who would be 30 today, and the number of people that were born in 1975, as you drop off the older group and they bought their own housing, there\xe2\x80\x99s a significant increase in rental demand.
[Joseph Guigan \xe2\x80\x93 Equity Research]
So you\xe2\x80\x99re advocating that there\xe2\x80\x99s an increase in the 22 to 34 that became that age between January and April of 2010 compared to what it was in September.
Terry Considine
That would be a very precise indicator. I think the general reason why we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through this entire recession with much lower declines in occupancies and property incomes is because of that very strong demographic demand.
[Joseph Guigan \xe2\x80\x93 Equity Research]
My question was specifically this, the economy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got better for regular people and the unemployment rate hasn\xe2\x80\x99t fallen. Yet you and other people in the apartment industry have pounded the table saying that rental prices got better between January and now. I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering why would that be when your tenants don\xe2\x80\x99t have, many of them not having jobs have increased. The number of them, their level of income hasn\xe2\x80\x99t increased. Why do you think that is?
Terry Considine
I\xe2\x80\x99ll try it again. I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a large number of employed people in our target ages. I think their confidence has improved. I think many people feel the economy bottomed perhaps three quarters ago. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had three quarters of positive growth. That will add to confidence, and so the employed members of our target markets I think feel more upbeat.
Let me just cut through this because I may not know the right answer, but I do know what happened and the fact is that our revenues are up quarter over quarter, month over month and are positive in our renewal business, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not out here beating drums trying to talk you into believing about the future. I\xe2\x80\x99m just telling you what\xe2\x80\x99s already happened through the end of April.
[Joseph Guigan \xe2\x80\x93 Equity Research]
Since average rental per unit is down 5.5% and it was 4.8% in the fourth quarter. So I guess you\xe2\x80\x99re saying rental prices are getting better. Why is that getting worse sequentially?
Terry Considine
It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem right to me, but let me check with the experts here. The last two months, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually a term we call ARPU which is average rent per occupied unit. It has increased each of the last two months.
[Joseph Guigan \xe2\x80\x93 Equity Research]
Okay, but I just want to get this. I want to make sure because this is important. You have a table right on your press release that says average rent per unit.
Ernest Freedman
We focus on revenue, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a game of balancing occupancy with revenue. So you are correct that this quarter period rates have come down, but we focus on revenue and that\xe2\x80\x99s a balancing act that the ops guys focus on all the time.
Overall revenues sequentially, quarter over quarter is up .2% from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and has gotten better and better on a month by month basis versus quarter to quarter.
[Joseph Guigan \xe2\x80\x93 Equity Research]
But you\xe2\x80\x99re not taking into consideration you sold off the unit that was lower prices, right.
Ernest Freedman
That\xe2\x80\x99s not true. Those charts that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to are on a same basis, so we take out the results from anything that\xe2\x80\x99s been sold from all periods.
[Joseph Guigan \xe2\x80\x93 Equity Research]
This table I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at where it says Conventional Same Store Operating Measures and then it says average rent per unit, it says $1,006.
Terry Considine
There\xe2\x80\x99s two issues here. One is revenue and one is occupancy as well as rate. On the rate question, there is a bundling and an unbundling questions. Sometimes just the way the package of goods and services offered to the customer, it will be bundled together and it will be in one rate, and some of it will aggregated and it will be less aggressive, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll pick it up in other areas. So you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to look at it all together.
Ernest Freedman
Let me suggest, I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to take the conversation off line with you just so we don\xe2\x80\x99t hold up other folks in the queue. You can give me a call. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to walk you through some more of it this afternoon.
