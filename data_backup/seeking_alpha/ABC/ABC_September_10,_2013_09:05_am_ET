Eric Coldwell \xe2\x80\x93 Robert W. Baird
Good morning everyone. My name\xe2\x80\x99s Eric Coldwell; I cover healthcare distribution technology and it\xe2\x80\x99s very nice to see you all with us this morning. We\xe2\x80\x99re very pleased to have AmerisourceBergen, Tim Guttman, the Chief Financial Officer; Barbara Brungess in the Investor Relations Department. It\xe2\x80\x99s always a pleasure to have ABC with us.
Given the schedule this morning and we\xe2\x80\x99re running a couple of minutes behind getting started we\xe2\x80\x99re going to again dispense with the formalities. Tim, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let you go to the stage and give a couple of slides and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go directly into the Q&A. Thank you.
Tim Guttman
Hi, good morning everyone. Tim Gutttman, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure to be here. Thanks for your interest in ABC. I just have a few slides; I want to leave time for Q&A. This is our required slide on risk factors and forward-looking statements. I\xe2\x80\x99d ask that you look at our 10(k) that we filed back in September, 2012, and also our (q)s from this year for all the risk factors. 
And let me just start again with an overview, kind of who we are. I\xe2\x80\x99ll start on the second bullet point. We are a large pharmaceutical services company. What that means is we have four business groups \xe2\x80\x93 our Drug Company, our Specialty Group, Consulting Services Group and World Currier. Those first two groups, Drug Company and Specialty, they deliver pharmaceutical drugs \xe2\x80\x93 brand, generics, specialty \xe2\x80\x93 to customers. 
All of our customers provide services to manufacturers. Specialty, Consulting Services and World Currier, they\xe2\x80\x99re 100% service organizations. And when I talk about consulting they can be services such as drug reimbursement, analysis and support strategies, running patient assistance programs, running patient adherence programs. And our World Currier business which we\xe2\x80\x99ve had for just a little bit over a year provides a high-touch logistics for clinical trials. And again, they\xe2\x80\x99re located in the US but they have a heavy presence internationally.
So all that translates into a company that\xe2\x80\x99s over $80 billion in annualized revenues, high volume, and that means we can deliver to 25,000 customers or more each day. We have excellent cash flow characteristics meaning that we can add new customers without adding a lot of inventory; and consistent performance since the merger that formed AmerisourceBergen. It\xe2\x80\x99s been eleven years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had about 17% cumulative EPS growth over that time period so above market performance.
The Drug Company is our core of business \xe2\x80\x93 kind of the engine that runs the company. You can see our distribution centers are large, sophisticated, highly automated DCs. I would say that really the Drug Company, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great industry. With demographics it\xe2\x80\x99s a growing industry \xe2\x80\x93 Baby Boomers. The couple points I\xe2\x80\x99d like to make: we\xe2\x80\x99re in good shape from a customer renewals standpoint. We\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot of heavy lifting. Our major customer contracts have all been renewed so from a customer loss perspective we\xe2\x80\x99re in great shape.
All of our customers except for our large PBM will buy generics from us which again is good for our business. Generics have a higher margin profile. And again, I would also make the comment that our Drug Company is the consistent performer and again, they\xe2\x80\x99re the ones that have excellent cash flow metrics and enable us to have a fairly high free cash flow.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s spend a minute and talk about what\xe2\x80\x99s new at ABC the last six months. Clearly our strategic relationships with Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s and Alliance Boots we announced back on March 19
That second bullet point, global sourcing opportunities \xe2\x80\x93 what that really means is that we\xe2\x80\x99re affiliates. We\xe2\x80\x99re affiliates, we\xe2\x80\x99re going out together, the three parties. We\xe2\x80\x99re contracting together to buy generics. And I think what we offer, we have a unique US and international scale with the amount of generics that we purchase and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to translate into better generic economics. 
And then finally that bottom one, a platform that we can build off of for specialty and manufacturing services consulting \xe2\x80\x93 taking our expertise and our assets, doing those services internationally, following the manufacturer and in some cases participating with Alliance Boots and maybe doing some co-investing. I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous opportunity over the long term there again with our expertise in those areas, their deep market knowledge. I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be a terrific combination together.
Both Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s and Alliance Boots will have a minority ownership in ABC that grows over time. We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a little bit about that. There\xe2\x80\x99s some warrants that we issued, and we think that\xe2\x80\x99s critically important because that allows for the interests to be aligned. They have a financial incentive to ensure that we perform well and we grow, and again, our objective is to have a win-win: make sure we perform well, we grow our business; investors benefit. And again, that\xe2\x80\x99s the incentive alignment through the equity position.
Just to wrap up on this slide I think it\xe2\x80\x99s critically important. The reason we really liked this transaction and the reason we did it is because it strengthens our core drug business. It enables us to add scale and volume, a large chain customer, a growing customer \xe2\x80\x93 something we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have. It enables us to get good generic pricing \xe2\x80\x93 two things that are critically important to our drug business. And we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do this transaction and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t require a large amount of capital like a traditional M&A deal. So again, we get the benefits of strengthening our business without having to use a lot of our capital.
And let me just wrap up here quickly, looking ahead. We\xe2\x80\x99re really encouraged with the industry and our prospects in the industry \xe2\x80\x93 that organic growth. Again demographics, healthcare reform are definitely moving in our favor. We have a pretty good launch calendar over the next couple of years and clearly there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong potential for biosimilars to come to market. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be a good thing for us, for ABC given our scale and scope in specialty and oncology. 
We talked about that second one: just to confirm, we think there\xe2\x80\x99s tremendous earnings power. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on the distribution agreement first, a procurement JV, get that up and running. And finally there\xe2\x80\x99s a slew of other opportunities where we can work together with our partners to bring some new opportunities to the market. 
And cash flow, near and dear to our hearts \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s critically important to our success. In the near term we will use working capital as we transition through the agreement in terms of how we buy the inventory, but again, once we\xe2\x80\x99re past full execution on that contract, we\xe2\x80\x99re fully up and running with all brand, all generic for that Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s contract we expect the free cash flow to accelerate going forward.
So in summary there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to like. We think we\xe2\x80\x99re well positioned. We talked about that 17% EPS growth we\xe2\x80\x99ve had over 11 years. We think there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty here to sustain mid-teens growth going forward. Thank you.

Eric Coldwell \xe2\x80\x93 Robert W. Baird
Tim, let\xe2\x80\x99s keep the ball rolling with Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s for a minute if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. You\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously had Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s as a client in the past, this is not an entirely new relationship. You\xe2\x80\x99ve also been in beta getting ready to ramp this distribution agreement for several months. Officially it went live about ten days ago \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious if you can let us know how that day one of the major go live on the formal contract, what that looked like.
Tim Guttman
Yeah, thanks. That\xe2\x80\x99s a great question. Last week was a big week for ABC. It was a historic week \xe2\x80\x93 we went live. We had been in kind of dress rehearsal for many months piloting. We went live with brand, delivering right to their stores and traditionally that day after Labor Day is our biggest sales day of the year. So when you combine that with starting to ship to Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s it was kind of a nervous Labor Day. We wanted to make sure everything was perfectly executed.
But we did really well. Our internal people, there were a few glitches here and there but things went out on time. We were worried about IT issues and just the sheer volume of transactions coming through the system. But we met with our internal people; they gave us a pretty good endorsement that the DCs managed it well. And then really the big news came over the weekend when we got feedback from Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s. They went out and they took a survey of about 100 of their stores, asked for some feedback on our performance, how we did. They got really good feedback and they shared it with us, so that really validated and made us feel real good that we worked hard and were on track.
And clearly there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of runway to go here. It\xe2\x80\x99s only been a week but I think we\xe2\x80\x99re off to a really good start. And again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that brand for the next few months and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll phase in generics. And generics will phase in over calendar \xe2\x80\x9914.
Eric Coldwell \xe2\x80\x93 Robert W. Baird
Are you doing 100% of the brand at this point? Is the legacy supplier completely shut off?
Tim Guttman
Yes, as far as I know we\xe2\x80\x99re 100% which is that critical date, right? That critical date was to make sure we could transition and do all the brand and we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that, and again, the generics will phase in. The generics will come from Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s, from what they sell distributed and move over to us. But off to a good start, and I want to say too, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s critically important is we also went out to our top customers. We surveyed our top customers to make sure that they were not feeling any kind of impact and their service levels were still really good. And all of our top customers said \xe2\x80\x9cHey, it was a non- event. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t see any disruption.\xe2\x80\x9d So again, that made us feel that we executed well with current customers and also Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s.
Eric Coldwell \xe2\x80\x93 Robert W. Baird
That\xe2\x80\x99s great. And you just mentioned the generics onboarding process, a calendar \xe2\x80\x9914 event. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you can put any more specific parameters on that. I think the original discussions from you and from Walgreens was that this was going to come out in waves, perhaps take 12 to 15 months is something we\xe2\x80\x99d heard from your partner. I\xe2\x80\x99m curious if you could give us some more information on the timing of the generics, and is it back-loaded, front-loaded? Is it equal phases? Do you have the sense and can you share it at this point?
Tim Guttman
Yeah, I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to say is you know, generics will phase in. Again, the brand represents the high dollars in terms of the revenues; the generics are all the high numbers of SKUs and volumes. So that generic, it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy. It\xe2\x80\x99s complicated and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it has to be phased in over the year. And I would expect that by the time we get to our fiscal year-end, close to our fiscal year-end which is the September quarter that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a majority of it kind of underway and we\xe2\x80\x99re wrapping up in F1Q, that last calendar quarter of \xe2\x80\x9914. 
But phased in gradually over time \xe2\x80\x93 if we can do it faster we will but again, we want to make sure. I mean we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a big customer, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got current customers. We want to make sure we do it right.

Eric Coldwell \xe2\x80\x93 Robert W. Baird
That\xe2\x80\x99s great. Again from the audience, if you have any questions feel free to send them in via the iPad. It did work in the last session so I think we\xe2\x80\x99re good to go. While there are a lot of unique aspects to this deal, it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a very long-term deal \xe2\x80\x93 generics are a huge piece of it \xe2\x80\x93 can you update us at all on where you are in terms of discussions with Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s and Alliance Boots on the joint venture and your sourcing agreement, and how you\xe2\x80\x99re talking to manufacturers, what kind of feedback you\xe2\x80\x99re getting from manufacturers, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten that far at this point? I know you haven\xe2\x80\x99t actually started the generics process formally in terms of distribution but there has to be a lot of behind-the-scenes work upfront and I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious if you can give us any idea on what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing there?
Tim Guttman
Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question and actually it\xe2\x80\x99s applicable from a timing standpoint. Next week Steve and the other two CEOs are actually going over to Switzerland and it\xe2\x80\x99s a big week. The procurement JV is based out of Switzerland and there\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of top-to-top meeting over there to really talk about what the process will be, the timeline, how it\xe2\x80\x99s going to work. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working for a long time the last few months on that. 
Really the thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked on for ABC is to get our representative. We need to have a representative \xe2\x80\x93 [Sicondi] is really an expat that is going to represent our interests and be at the table during negotiations. We\xe2\x80\x99ve identified that executive, a very seasoned executive \xe2\x80\x93 knows the industry well, had to be signed off by our partners. So we have that person identified. They\xe2\x80\x99ll go over and join the joint venture.
We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of contact with generic manufacturers and they\xe2\x80\x99re all very supportive. The feedback that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten informally, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in our offices, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had discussions at conferences and I would say really they view it as a win-win. I mean when you think about this, and again, I said it on the stage \xe2\x80\x93 when there\xe2\x80\x99s a unique opportunity to get US and international scale, when you can take that to a generic manufacturer, offer them a multi-year contract, they view that as a big positive. And not only is it a fairly large volume but it\xe2\x80\x99s growing, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to grow over the next few years. 
So again, they see that as a positive; they see that as a way to run their operations more efficiently, buy better and that\xe2\x80\x99s worth something. And what we\xe2\x80\x99re asking in return is better economics. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve had discussions, they\xe2\x80\x99re supportive, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting good feedback but the next step is really to start the process and to start meeting with them in Switzerland and negotiate and execute contracts. That\xe2\x80\x99s a long process \xe2\x80\x93 to get from negotiation to contract execution can take several months.
Eric Coldwell \xe2\x80\x93 Robert W. Baird
Okay, fair enough. You mentioned in your early prepared remarks that you see opportunities to co-invest with Alliance Boots to make some long-term I guess, call it Phase III opportunities around manufacturers and other products. You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about that a lot. I\xe2\x80\x99m curious specifically how much exposure do you have if any today to Alliance Boots\xe2\x80\x99 proprietary products, for example the Almus lines, the Alvita lines, the medical-surgical consumable and cosmetic and dermatology? And do you see a situation where more and more of those proprietary Alliance lines are coming into the US and going into perhaps your Good Neighbor Pharmacy Network or other customers of ABC? How much today if any and how soon might we see that?
Tim Guttman
That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. I mean Alliance Foods, they are a terrific company. That Almus brand is really a big item in Europe, a very popular brand, well-recognized. It is a generic but it is a brand in and of itself. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve had some discussions and we\xe2\x80\x99re very interested in how to get that to the states. We think that would be a positive for our GNP members but good things take time, right? And again we\xe2\x80\x99ve focused on a distribution and procurement JV and once we kind of get those moving along we\xe2\x80\x99ll look at this third bucket which would be front store, private label, other things we can do together. And clearly Almus is a part of that and we do have a high level of interest in taking a look at that.
Eric Coldwell \xe2\x80\x93 Robert W. Baird
Do you see ABC becoming vertically integrated?
Tim Guttman
I really don\xe2\x80\x99t see us going there. You know, moving up the supply chain and almost becoming a manufacturer is something we don\xe2\x80\x99t have an interest in. We have an interest in contracting and sourcing and that\xe2\x80\x99s really what we think our expertise is. So I don\xe2\x80\x99t see us moving all the way up, but when we can and it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate contracting we would.
Eric Coldwell \xe2\x80\x93 Robert W. Baird
Okay, fair enough. The debate when this relationship was first announced centered on obviously a lot of positives especially in the intermediate to long term with the Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s/Alliance Boots deal. But there was some concern in the investment community and among some of the observers of this industry that perhaps you would have some customers that would feel there was a conflict of interests or be worried about their service levels, what have you. I think those concerns have abated dramatically, and you loosely referenced this a few minutes ago but I\xe2\x80\x99m curious a few months in, where are you with your customers? Have you had any challenging discussions? Have you lost any customers due specifically to this event? Where do you see attrition rates over time?
Tim Guttman
Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer then and I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Barb answer. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great question, and we made the announcement on 3/19. It was a big headline and then I think, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6 G NP is a big, important franchise to us \xe2\x80\x93 almost 5000 strong in our GNP network. It\xe2\x80\x99s critically important to us, and a lot of those customers are long-term, dedicated ABC customers and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to jeopardize that. And I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99d say is there were a couple concerns initially, one about service levels and two about any kind of if there were shortages with drugs would they not get their drugs, would the allocation go specifically to Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s. 
And we heard about that and we\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed that and we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a number of meetings. Post 3/19 we really did a great job with management and our sales force getting out and meeting with our GNP customers, explaining what the transaction is, how it can benefit us, how it can benefit them longer-term. We had a big trade show at the end of July where we brought in a large majority of our GNP customers. Steve met with a lot of the large customers, talked to them about what it means to have Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s and ABC as partners, what it means to have a couple of the executives on our Board and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a better comfort level about all that.
Let me say emphatically, I am not aware of any customers we\xe2\x80\x99ve lost to date. And we talk about it all the time \xe2\x80\x93 every time we meet with a drug company and review their numbers, through their business plan we ask them, we make sure. But to be candid it\xe2\x80\x99s only been six months since the announcement so I do believe we\xe2\x80\x99re in a wait-and-see mode. I made that comment that what\xe2\x80\x99s good for us is also good for our GNP customers so I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong belief that ultimately they\xe2\x80\x99ll benefit. 
So the burden\xe2\x80\x99s on us here over the next several months. At some point we need to demonstrate value to them, to our customers and begin to make sure that when it\xe2\x80\x99s time for renewal they don\xe2\x80\x99t come back to us and say \xe2\x80\x9c Hey, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get anything from you guys.\xe2\x80\x9d So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s, like you mentioned, Eric \xe2\x80\x93 private label, front store merchandising, maybe some Boots product, maybe better payer contracts. I think there\xe2\x80\x99s some things we need to demonstrate and show. These are small business owners and they care about the economics of their pharmacies so we need to demonstrate how they\xe2\x80\x99ll benefit. And I think we will. We have some good ideas. Barb, anything?
Barb Brungess
No, I think I would just echo that in July we had our annual trade show for our retail customer base and we had really good turnout there. And of course a lot of the dialog was around the relationship we now have with Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s. And I think for the most part our customers are in kind of a wait-and-see mode and that they are approaching it with the thought that what\xe2\x80\x99s good for the wholesaler is ultimately (inaudible) good for them. So it\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent on us to continue to provide them with very high service levels and keep them in trade with some opportunities that we see on the horizon, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a very good space.
Eric Coldwell \xe2\x80\x93 Robert W. Baird
No margin, no mission. If you can help your customers with the margin I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll probably stick with you. The audience has four questions. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to read them verbatim. I think a couple have been loosely addressed but we\xe2\x80\x99ll attack it on a different angle on the first one and see if this is a more specific way of asking a question that prompts a different response. First question: are you negotiating new generics contracts now for the January 1 Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s start? Are you getting the price reductions you had expected?
Tim Guttman
Yeah, I loosely \xe2\x80\x93 you\xe2\x80\x99re right, Eric, we talked about it. We\xe2\x80\x99re really in, using a baseball analogy of nine innings we\xe2\x80\x99re probably in the first inning. We have our [Sicondi]; we have the kickoff with the executives next week. We\xe2\x80\x99ll start to contact generic manufacturers and start to negotiate and work through that, so it\xe2\x80\x99s really early. 
And again, when we gave our guidance back in March and we talked about the incremental $0.20 in \xe2\x80\x9914, very little of that was from the procurement JV because we said most of that will be from the benefit from the distribution agreement. The procurement JV will really take effect and benefit us in our F2015. So still early, a lot to do, just starting but again, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a few months. But I tell you, guys, in six months I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reason to believe that the economics\xe2\x80\xa6 We firmly believe that scale translates into better economics. I mean size matters. That\xe2\x80\x99s really the bottom line and it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed our perspective on that.
Eric Coldwell \xe2\x80\x93 Robert W. Baird
Second question: how big is the free cash flow drag from ramping the Walgreen\xe2\x80\x99s inventory? It seems like Cardinal is getting an over $0.5 billion benefit. Is that your inventory increase on the branded side? So does what your peers see equate to what you\xe2\x80\x99ll be seeing on the flipside?
Tim Guttman
I would say loosely yes. It is a drag. We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it; we gave guidance earlier in the year about free cash flow $700 million, $800 million, now that\xe2\x80\x99s down to $100 million to $200 million \xe2\x80\x93 again, the drag of buying inventory early this year and most of it brand. Again, we have an impact again next year because the generics, you get better terms and better cash metrics with generics as that generic business phases in over time in \xe2\x80\x9914. 
So still a little bit of a drag early in our F2014, turning at the end of F2014. But once we get past all that and we get into \xe2\x80\x9915 we really expect our free cash flow to accelerate and be strong. Typically our free cash flow is around our net income. We\xe2\x80\x99d expect it in \xe2\x80\x9915 and \xe2\x80\x9916 to be better than that. And it\xe2\x80\x99s early but that would be kind of my initial answer.
Eric Coldwell \xe2\x80\x93 Robert W. Baird
Very good. Next question, I\xe2\x80\x99ll paraphrase is do you expect any growth in the market overall? In other words, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with volumes, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with utilization? What do you see as the current trends?
Tim Guttman
Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer the first part, I\xe2\x80\x99ll flip it over to Barb. I would say that it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a significant change. I mean there were some positive trends earlier in the year, probably around January, kind of the start of the calendar year. I think maybe some of that was seasonal flu, it was a late flu season \xe2\x80\x93 I think maybe that impacted, cough, cold, flu. I think the flu definitely impacted with the way it ramped up. 
And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing any significant change in the market. I mean for our growth, our growth is really coming from our big new customer Express that we on-boarded. We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing some pretty good growth in our specialty business, above market in two of our businesses, ASD and Besse. In terms of just kind of looking out, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve moderated a bit in terms of like \xe2\x80\x9914 and in terms of healthcare reform. It seems like it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a little bit longer to ramp up and get the public to sign up, and so I think for us it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be kind of a big deal or a big impact in \xe2\x80\x9914.
I think \xe2\x80\x9915, after a little bit of a ramp up I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll see a positive in \xe2\x80\x9915 for healthcare reform. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Barb, if you have anything from your perspective on script growth?
Barb Brungess
Yeah, we don\xe2\x80\x99t really track script trends directly but I think the trends are probably better this year than where they were last year, although I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call it a dramatic difference. I think there is underlying growth in our business and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that, I think the one thing you didn\xe2\x80\x99t touch on is as the economy improves and as employment improves.
Tim Guttman
Oh, definitely.
Barb Brungess
Those are commercial plan payers coming into the system, those are good customers for our customers. So we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful about that. As the overall economy improves it can only help.
Eric Coldwell \xe2\x80\x93 Robert W. Baird
But a good idea for the street to not get too far ahead of its skates on PPACA volumes coming in next year.
Barb Brungess
At least not in \xe2\x80\x9914.
Eric Coldwell \xe2\x80\x93 Robert W. Baird
Have you done any additional modeling on what you think the long-term impact could be? Or are there still so many moving pieces that it\xe2\x80\x99s premature to go that far?
Tim Guttman
I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Eric, if we\xe2\x80\x99re that far along. If we get a benefit of 1% to 2% we\xe2\x80\x99d be thrilled but again, it\xe2\x80\x99s early and we really haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at it. Right now we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on our F2014 plan which is due to our Board here at the end of September, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll launch into kind of a longer-term plan, but those are just some initial thoughts.
Eric Coldwell \xe2\x80\x93 Robert W. Baird
And we have one minute left. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any additional questions from the audience unless someone wants to chime in? Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s do this \xe2\x80\x93 specialty, a big business for ABC, an important business. Your oncology supply was flat Q-to-Q last period but it was down year-over-year which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a big surprise I think given some of the changes we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen with reimbursement in the sequester. I guess can you give us any updates on how you fared through the summer? Are you seeing any changes in community oncology practice demand? Have you seen any abatement in the pressures that were experienced early or the early response from community oncologists perhaps to kick some patients to other settings? If you can give us an update on where you are with the specialty group that would be great.
Tim Guttman
Yeah. Specialty is a very important franchise for us, for ABC. It\xe2\x80\x99s an above-market grower. Even with a little bit of a drag from oncology supply we\xe2\x80\x99ve still had really solid growth again from ASD and our Besse businesses. We do have oncology business in our ASD business and in some other specialty businesses, so when we talk oncology we talk oncology supply which is direct-to-physician, physician-administered.
I would say things have stabilized. Again, sequester reimbursement definitely impacted us. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a small practice, a small- to medium-sized practice and you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a reimbursement cut it\xe2\x80\x99s tough on your economics. And we definitely need reimbursement restored to make it healthy. But again sequentially we\xe2\x80\x99re kind of flat. Longer-term we could have some risk there if we don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer on reimbursement. The larger practices, again which are kind of our sweet spot are doing well and growing. The smaller ones are struggling a bit but we\xe2\x80\x99re optimistic that Washington will get it right and put the care back in community oncology where it belongs. Better outcomes, lower costs \xe2\x80\x93 I mean that\xe2\x80\x99s really the answer.
Eric Coldwell \xe2\x80\x93 Robert W. Baird
That\xe2\x80\x99s great. Thank you so much for your time today. We have hit the limit. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask everyone joining me in thanking AmerisourceBergen.
