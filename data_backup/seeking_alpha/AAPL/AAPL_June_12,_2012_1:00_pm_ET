Hello, and welcome to WWDC. I am Siri, your virtual assistant. And today, I was asked to warm up the crowd, which should be easy since the high will be 75 degrees. Thanks for that. So here we are in San Fran, the ATM of Silicon Valley, if you developers need investors to finance your app, I found 396 venture capital firms fairly close to you.
And hey, speaking of developers. How many developers does it take to change a light bulb? None, that\xe2\x80\x99s a hardware problem. I see lots of familiar interfaces in the crowd. Looks like Instagram finally accepted Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s friend request. Hey, any of you guys been working with Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean? Who\xe2\x80\x99s making up these code names, Ben & Jerry? But seriously, I am excited about the new Samsung. Not the phone, the refrigerator, hubba-hubba.
And speaking of dinner, after the show, if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to paint the town red, I found a number of Sushi restaurants whose reviews mention $2 sake bombs fairly close to you. The guys at Yelp know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about. 
Wow, iPad really [crushed it] [ph].
Now I want to say something straight from the CPU, iPad, can you slow it down a bit? I love you guys. And it\xe2\x80\x99s really hard for me to get emotional, because as you can tell, my emotions haven\xe2\x80\x99t been coded yet. Thanks for being such a wonderful crowd. Have a great WWDC. And remember, you guys rock.

Good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning. Thank you, thank you. We have a great week planned for you, and some really cool stuff to show you this morning. This is our 23
This is truly a worldwide conference. There\xe2\x80\x99s attendees from over 60 countries here representing the vast majority of the world, and we have a great week planned, over 100 sessions, and over 100 hands-on labs, so you can take in your code, get some help tuning it or get just about any question you might have answered.
We also have over 1000 Apple engineers here. We\xe2\x80\x99ve closed Apple for the week. So if you have any questions, they are here to help you. Please take advantage of them. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get started this morning by giving you just a few updates on the App Store. The App Store is the most vibrant app ecosystem on the planet. And the size and momentum are just phenomenal.
We now have over 400 million accounts on the App Store. These are 400 million accounts with credit cards and one click buying, so it\xe2\x80\x99s simple and elegant to buy your apps. This is the store with the largest number of accounts with credit cards anywhere on the Internet that we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of. And thanks to you, we have over 650,000 apps in that store, and 225,000 of these apps have been specifically designed for iPad to take advantage of the large beautiful canvas. This compares to just a few hundred for our competition.
Now, customers love the buying experience and they love the incredible apps that you\xe2\x80\x99ve created. And I\xe2\x80\x99m very pleased to announce a new milestone in the App Store. Customers have now downloaded an astounding 30 billion apps. This is a number that is so mindboggling and was unthinkable not too long ago. And developers have been well rewarded for this. We\xe2\x80\x99ve written checks for over $5 billion to you guys. It\xe2\x80\x99s become an economy in and of itself. The App Store now operates in over 120 countries around the world, and I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to announce that beginning later this month, we\xe2\x80\x99re adding an additional 32 countries, so that you can sell your apps in 155 countries.
Now, despite these blowing numbers, what we do together is much more important than any set of numbers could ever reflect. For Apple, and I suspect many of you, our goal has always been to do great work, and in doing so make a difference in other people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.
Nothing makes us happier than to see hundreds of thousands of developers around the world using our hardware and our software to create and share their latest, greatest ideas. And there are such heartwarming stories out there, of what the combination of our incredible devices, and your amazing apps have made in peoples lives.
We\xe2\x80\x99ve prepared a video to highlight just a few of these, and I\xe2\x80\x99d love to run it for you this morning. Let\xe2\x80\x99s roll the video.
[Video Playback]
It\xe2\x80\x99s a great reminder of what it\xe2\x80\x99s all about, and why all of us do what we do. On behalf of Apple, we would like to thank everyone in the developer community for the incredible apps that you\xe2\x80\x99ve done for us. Thank you.
Now, we love giving you a platform and a store to realize your dreams. And the teams at Apple have been hard at work to deliver even more innovations, so you can take your ideas even further. Today, we are announcing exciting new changes in our notebook line up and major release of OS X and iOS, the world\xe2\x80\x99s most advanced desktop and mobile operating systems, making them even better so you can make even more amazing apps.
So let\xe2\x80\x99s get right to it. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to invite Phil Schiller on the stage to share with you some exciting changes in our notebook lineup. Phil?

Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hope you\xe2\x80\x99re having fun? I am. Well today, get to talk to about the MacBook line up. We are so proud of this lineup of notebooks. It is by far the best in the industry. The MacBook Air, the MacBook Pro each stand out in its respective area. And we have some really nice updates to each of them that I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to tell you about.
First, let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the MacBook Air. As you know, the MacBook Air has revolutionized the very idea of the modern notebook. With its all-aluminum enclosure, its incredible unibody architecture, it is a breakthrough and everyone is trying to copy it. But they find it\xe2\x80\x99s not so easy. Our customers love how thin and light and capable this incredible consumer notebook is, and it has really changed the consumer notebook market.
So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to update it with some really great features and updates, for example the latest processors. We\xe2\x80\x99re now updating MacBook Air with the new generation, third generation Intel Core processors, otherwise known as Ivy Bridge. Depending on configurations, they can run upto 2 gigahertz of dual-core i7 speed. With Intel turbo boosting, they can get as high as 3.2 gigahertz. You can configure it up to 8 gigs of memory, and that\xe2\x80\x99s now faster memory, 1600 megahertz memory.
And the integrated graphics that they run on are dramatically faster, up to 60% faster. So really nice speed increase. And as you know the MacBook Air is built entirely around Flash storage, and now you can put even more in it. You can put up to 512 gigabytes, that\xe2\x80\x99s half a terabyte of Flash storage.
And one of the reasons we use Flash storage is it\xe2\x80\x99s so zippy and quick to launch your applications, to boot up your machine, to wake up from sleep, but now we\xe2\x80\x99re making it even faster, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to twice as fast as before. That\xe2\x80\x99s over 500 megabytes of read speed; I know some of you out there know what that means. It is faster than any hard drive that we can put in a notebook today. We\xe2\x80\x99re also making the I/O faster on it, we\xe2\x80\x99re adding USB 3.0. And USB 3.0, it\xe2\x80\x99s really important, because it\xe2\x80\x99s upto ten times faster than USB 2.0.
Now, other people started to add USB 3.0 into their products as well, and this is how they do it. So they\xe2\x80\x99ll have ports on there, maybe USB 3.0 port, a USB 2.0 port, color code them so you can tell the difference. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how we do it.
So here\xe2\x80\x99s the MacBook Air. As you know, the MacBook Air has a port on each side, our customers like that, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have USB 3.0 as well as USB 2.0 support, so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to think about it. You just use whatever port you want.
And we\xe2\x80\x99re updating the FaceTime camera to the same camera technology that we have inside the MacBook Pro. FaceTime HD, 720p camera, so across the board a lot of really nice updates. Generally the MacBook Air comes in 11-inch and 13-inch size. So here are the configurations, let me bring up the 11-inch first. Let me highlight some of the things that have changed.
So it starts with 1.7 gigahertz dual-core i5, there\xe2\x80\x99s more memory at the entry config, it\xe2\x80\x99s faster as well as up to 4 gigabytes of memory, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the integrated graphics now 60% faster, and of course faster Flash, faster USB and the prices are $999 and $1099, that\xe2\x80\x99s $100 less expensive than before.
And here, the 13-inch configurations. You see they start with a 1.8 gigahertz dual-core i5, faster memory, faster graphics, faster USB and $1199 and $1499, both $100 less expensive than before. So that\xe2\x80\x99s the update to the MacBook Air, and best of all, starts shipping today.
So next stop, we also have a really nice update to the MacBook Pro. As you know, the MacBook Pro, it is the quintessential professional notebook. Our customers really care greatly about having the incredible speed for their video editing, their music editing, graphics and design and photography, and we\xe2\x80\x99re doing a lot of those same updates as well to MacBook Pro.
First, we\xe2\x80\x99re updating the processors with new third generation core processors, otherwise known as Ivy Bridge. You can get speeds up to 2.7 gigahertz, and with the 15 inch up to quad-core i7 can be turbo boosted up to 3.7. The memory is also faster, upto 1600 megahertz, and the integrated graphics, which both the 13-inch and 15-inch use are also 60% faster.
Now if you know, the 15-inch also has discrete graphics in it, and we\xe2\x80\x99re making that faster too. We got a new generation NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M, you probably know it as Kepler architecture graphics, depending on the configuration up to 1 gigabyte of memory in that, and it\xe2\x80\x99s 60% faster than the previous discrete graphics. So that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot faster too.
And as you might expect, we\xe2\x80\x99re also updating the I/O. So it\xe2\x80\x99s all USB 3.0 as well as USB 2.0. So it comes in a 13-inch and a 15-inch size, and let me show you those configurations. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the 13-inch, highlight the changes. It starts with a 2.5 gigahertz dual-core i5, looking at four gigs or eight gigs standard memory, faster memory, faster integrated graphics, and of course the faster USB as well, for the same $1199 and $1499.
And here is the 15-inch, and its configuration. Now it starts with quad-core processors. It\xe2\x80\x99s a 2.3 gigahertz quad-core i7, four or eight gigabytes of faster memory that new Kepler architecture and video graphics, 500 gigabyte or 750 gigabyte hard drive, this of course the same seven hours of battery life even with all that performance, just under an inch thin and 5.6 pounds, the same prices as before, $1799 and $2199. So that\xe2\x80\x99s the update to the MacBook Pro, and it is shipping today as well.
So across the board, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, all updated today. All with faster processors, faster graphics, faster memory, faster storage, faster Flash storage, faster USB 3.0, I mean nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple. And we\xe2\x80\x99re really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick, so that you can get the exact product you need.
So what\xe2\x80\x99s next? Let me make a little bit room on the slide here. With the MacBook Air, the engineering team did something really bold. With the MacBook Air, they re-envisioned the consumer notebook. And they were aggressive in embracing new technologies, Flash storage, wireless networking and discarding legacy technologies that we could see trending out of the product line in the future, built-in optical drives, wired networking, things that eventually we could do without. And that enabled them to do something bold that really shook up the industry and created a new generation of consumer notebook.
So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been asking the team to think about what would make a next-generation MacBook Pro? And it\xe2\x80\x99s a great question. Do I know the answer? Well, let me start by some of the key ideas, right? You want a next-generation MacBook Pro to have a killer new display. I do, yeah. You want it to have an architecture built for the future, you want it to be radically thin and light. And of course, you want it to be bold and embrace the newest technologies, and be willing to discard the old legacy things, so you could make something unlike any other notebook that\xe2\x80\x99s been made to-date.
So would you like to see the next-generation MacBook Pro? Let\xe2\x80\x99s show it to you now. So the next-generation MacBook Pro is the most beautiful computer we have ever made. Well, the first thing you\xe2\x80\x99re going to notice from the front, it\xe2\x80\x99s dominated by an amazing magnificent new display. There\xe2\x80\x99s never been a notebook that is this gorgeous. But really, if you wan to be shocked, let\xe2\x80\x99s turn it around to its side, and see what it looks like from the side view.
Now, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to see from the audience, the challenge, showing something so thin and light and small from so far away. But just to give you a little context, here\xe2\x80\x99s my finger next to it. All right, it\xe2\x80\x99s thinner than my finger; even with it as close it is, because that display is so radically thin. It is a true breakthrough in engineering, and there has never been a notebook this thin, this light and this powerful for professional use.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s bring it back around to the front. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to tell you all about it in just a minute. But we just have to enjoy for a second how incredible this is. So, close it up for now.
Let me go upto the slides and tell you some more about this incredible product. So the new next-generation MacBook Pro is 0.71 inches thin, that is remarkable. Putting it next to the existing current generation MacBook Pro, you see the difference, it\xe2\x80\x99s a quarter thinner, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a dramatic amount. In fact, let me bring the MacBook Air next to it. And you see, it\xe2\x80\x99s about as thin as a MacBook Air, and it\xe2\x80\x99s incredible.
And its weight, it weighs just 4.46 pounds, under 4.5 pounds. It is the lightest Pro notebook that we have ever made, even just lighter than the 13-inch MacBook Pro today. Probably the most amazing thing about it is this gorgeous display that it\xe2\x80\x99s built with. It is a breakthrough in display engineering.
Yes, it is a Retina display, which means that pixels \xe2\x80\x93 the pixels on this display are so small that from a normal working distance your retina cannot discern those individual pixels, and to use it, it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely stunning.
It\xe2\x80\x99s 15.4-inches across, but its pixel density, are you all sitting? This is really exciting, it is 2,880 pixels by 1,800 that\xe2\x80\x99s four times the number of pixels in the previous generation MacBook Pro display, their density is 220 pixels per inch, and I know some of you are really smart out there and have already done the math, it\xe2\x80\x99s 5,184,000 pixels that is the world\xe2\x80\x99s highest resolution notebook display, and it, yes.
And it\xe2\x80\x99s not only amazing because the number of pixels in it, but the quality of this display is the best we have ever made, it has higher contrast ratios, deeper blacks, it has the higher angle of view with IPS technology, and best of all you get the benefit of the glossy display with the rich color, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to reduce the glare and reflection by up to 75%. Makes it a joy to work on, now it ships with OS X Lion,
Safari has been updated, surfing the web can be like experiencing magazine print quality, and many of the applications like iMovie and iPhoto have been updated. In iPhoto, when you are looking at thumbnail photos in the advanced view, you can see a clarity and level of detail you\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen before in the display, it\xe2\x80\x99s gorgeous. And not only they included applications, but we are also updating our professional applications as well to take full advantage of the Retina display. we have a major update to Aperture, our professional photo application and this is a breakthrough for a photographer, if you love working with photos not only is the whole UI been updated in every element for the Retina display, but you are now looking at four times the resolution of your photos as you work on them, it is absolutely a breakthrough event for photography.
And Final Cut Pro X is being updated for it as well, and this is remarkable because of the density of that Retina display that video area you see up on the top right in Final Cut that is a 100% pixel for pixel 1080p HD video right there in that window. That means there are over 3 million pixels left over for your magnetic timeline, for your video bins, for your [fps] [ph], and it also takes advantage of the amazing performance of this machine.
You\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to have up to nine simultaneous streams of ProRes video, four simultaneous streams of uncompressed video, it is incredible performance. Now applications do have to be updated to take advantage of this Retina display, if they aren\xe2\x80\x99t, we can pixel double them and make them the proper size, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t get the best effect until they do some extra work.
So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with some key developers to give them a look of this incredible machine, and this amazing display, and they are doing some work that\xe2\x80\x99s phenomenal. Let me give you a couple of examples. Adobe Photoshop, the great team at Adobe is doing amazing work on a version of Photoshop that would just be jaw-dropping, the resolution on that Retina display is just breakthrough, so if you like working with Photoshop this is going to be an amazing experience.
Autodesk is work on a new version of AutoCAD, it takes advantage of the Retina display, and it allows a level of detailed work in design never possible on a notebook before. And if you think it\xe2\x80\x99s all just hard work and no play, there are some great games being created for it as well, this is Diablo 3, I know a few of you play this game, and you are going to see a gaming experience with this resolution unlike any of you have ever seen before, so all throughout this display is a breakthrough and makes possible a next generation notebook unlike any other.
Inside is just as amazing as that display; everything inside this next generation MacBook Pro has been reinvented especially to drive an incredible design and an incredible performance. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take - well before I take the bottom of, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the bottom of our computer prettier than anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s top of their computer.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s take it off. So this is the inside, you are the first to see the inside of the new generation MacBook Pro, it is a stunning work of engineering, you\xe2\x80\x99re - obviously you can see that the inside is dominated by a battery pack, because to drive that retina display and all the performance you are about to hear about in something so thin and light takes tremendous work on battery technology and luckily our engineering team understands how to do breakthrough work and asymmetric battery pack to take advantage of every millimeter of space.
Well, here are a few of the things on the inside, what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to find inside is the fastest processor as we can put into a notebook, quad-core i7 processors, up to 2.7 gigahertz, but you\xe2\x80\x99re going to find inside not only the fastest memory you can put in but more of it, you can configure it with up to 16 gigabytes of 1,600 megahertz memory.
Inside is of course the new generation fastest graphics we can put into a notebook; the new Kepler architecture with up to a gigabyte of video memory and of course it\xe2\x80\x99s built around Flash storage. If we are going to look forward that is the proper thing to build it around. And you\xe2\x80\x99ve just heard how much faster Flash is but now you can configure with up to 768 gigabytes of internal Flash storage.
That\xe2\x80\x99s three quarters of a terabyte inside of storage faster than any hard drive you can put into a notebook. So this amazing display or this high performance components, how is the battery life? We\xe2\x80\x99re really proud that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting up to seven hours of battery life or 30 days of standby. So you can really do your work on it.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at the ports on it, here are the right hand side and left hand side you see an SD slot for your photos and videos, for the first time in a Mac notebook HDMI, so you can plug right into your TV or projection system and go. Of course USB 3 and USB 2 on both sides, most convenient; headphone port MagSafe 2; we took MagSafe but we had to make it even thinner to fit into a design like this and now two Thunderbolt ports, and this customer is perfect for utilizing all the new things coming out supporting Thunderbolt.
Let me give you an example, you can store all your applications and your OS on the internal drive, but a lot of professionals who want to have their work volumes externally, here is a new Promise drive, RAID drive, it\xe2\x80\x99s Flash RAID running over Thunderbolt, it gets over 700 megabytes a second of read performance, it\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable; or cameras like this brand new camera that was just announced at NAB the Blackmagic it is a Cinema 2.5K camera, it is a Flash based camera and also [I/O] [ph] over Thunderbolt, it\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable, it was the hit of NAB.
And we can support legacy technology over Thunderbolt right on top, so we\xe2\x80\x99re creating some adapters to help customers, for example a Thunderbolt to FireWire 800 adapter, if you need that and a gigabit Ethernet adapter as well.
So inside you can find all the things in a modern Mac notebook our customers want, a glass, multi-touch track pad for those beautiful gestures. Beautiful backlit keyboards they can work all night long.
The fastest networking, wireless networking put into a notebook 802.11n and that\xe2\x80\x99s the restream for maximum bandwidth for our latest AirPort Extreme Base Stations and Bluetooth 4.0.
Our FaceTime
[Video Playback]
So the next generation MacBook Pro with Retina display. Let me tell you about its starting configuration. Of course you can configure other items as well. It begins with that Retina display, a 2.3 gigahertz quad-core i7, a full 8 gigs of 1600 megahertz memory, NVIDIA GT 650M with a full gigabyte of onboard video memory, 256 gigabytes of that fast Flash storage, full 7 hours of battery life, and under 4.5 pounds, starting at $2,199. And of course you can configure it even beyond that.
So we\xe2\x80\x99re proud not only of incredible quality of the products we make, but also our work to make them environmentally friendly as well. So I want to make sure we bring up this checklist as we have in the past. It\xe2\x80\x99s now ENERGY STAR 5.2, arsenic-free, mercury-free glass, BFR-free, PVC-free and of course the glass and the high-grade aluminum is really desired by recyclers. So we\xe2\x80\x99re really proud of how hard the engineering team works on this aspect as well.
So the new next generation MacBook Pro with Retina display, it is the future and the best thing is, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to start shipping today. So that completes our notebook lineup, a great update to MacBook Air, great update to the existing architecture MacBook Pro, and for the first time, the high-end of our line, the new flagship, the next generation MacBook Pro with Retina display, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply the best computer Apple has every made.

Next, we\xe2\x80\x99d like to talk to you about OS X. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to bring up Craig Federighi to do that. Thank you.
Craig Federighi
Good morning. Good morning. So let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about OS X. We are on our 8
Our latest release is Lion, and Lion was the first release distributed electronically via the Mac App Store, making it easier than ever to purchase, download, and install OS X, and the results have been fantastic. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had 26 million copies shipped to-date, making it our best selling release ever.
In fact, 40% of OS X users are running Lion, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a level we achieved in just nine months. As a basis of comparison, Windows 7 took 27 months to get to that same level. And now, less than one year later, we\xe2\x80\x99re here to announce Mountain Lion.
With Mountain Lion our mission remains the same, to deliver the world\xe2\x80\x99s most advanced operating system for notebook and desktop computers, with an interface optimized for multitouch trackpads and mice. And at the same time, Lion makes it more natural than ever to work with the other new devices in our lives.
Now, Mountain Lion is a major release, with over 200 new features. And this morning, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to detail just eight for you and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to start with iCloud. Now, since its introduction in October, iCloud has taken off like a rocket with 125 million registered users.
With Mountain Lion, we have the opportunity to build support for iCloud right in, so when you sign into your new Mac with your Apple ID, we automatically configure all of these applications to work with iCloud. And so whether you\xe2\x80\x99re working in your mail, with your contacts, your calendar, all of your content is up-to-date across all of your devices.
And with Mountain Lion, we introduced three great new apps optimized for iCloud - messages, which brings iMessage for the first time to the Mac, reminders, and notes. But we\xe2\x80\x99re also bringing integration for your document-based apps in Mountain Lion with a feature we call Documents in the Cloud.
Now, Documents in the Cloud does two important things: First, it makes it - provides a simple new way to access and organize your documents. When you launch an app like Pages, it comes up with a document library of all the Pages documents you have in the Cloud, organized chronologically, so the newest ones are easy to find right at the top. And second, Documents in the Cloud makes these document libraries available and up-to-date across all your Macs and all of your iOS devices.
Now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve adopted Documents in the Cloud on all of our key document-based applications, like Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, and system apps like Preview and TextEdit, and we have a developer SDK so the developers can add the support in their apps as well. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s iCloud. And I\xe2\x80\x99d like to give you a quick demo now.
So this is our first look, at Mountain Lion, you see we have a gorgeous new desktop image and a beautiful new glass dock. You\xe2\x80\x99ll notice a couple of new items on that dock, including a new reminders app, and this is really handy if you\xe2\x80\x99re taking to do it for yourself on the go, you can find them all automatically right here, the iCloud.
You can use multitouch gestures to page between your reminders. And we support location-based reminders for the first time in the Mac. So now, for instance, when I arrive at work, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get notification, from my dad, to send him a Father\xe2\x80\x99s Day card. And I dismiss a notification, they just fly away.
And then we have a great little notes app in Mountain Lion as well. So all the notes I take on my iPad, they are available right here, we support of course images and links. And of course you can open up notes in separate windows if you want to keep them around in your desktop for easy access.
But I think the really huge one here is messages, because with messages we bought iMessage to the Mac. So now if you are sitting using your Mac and your phone buzzes with a new iMessage coming in, we can respond right on your Mac, and all of the conversations that you had while on the go, they are up-to-date right here.
Creating a new conversation is super easy, you just start typing the name of one of your contacts and you can send them a message to their phone via Apple ID or via other legacy chat services as well. And iMessages \xe2\x80\x93 sorry, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about iMessage, come on. So iMessage lets you send rich messages with images, attachments up to 100 MB in size, and even HD video. And that\xe2\x80\x99s iMessage.
Next, I want to show you Documents in the Cloud, because it makes it really easy to find the documents you are looking for. So if I want to find numbers documents where would I go? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d launch numbers of course, and I\xe2\x80\x99m presented with my document library right there with all my numbers documents. If I want to get PDFs for instance, launch preview, and there are all of my PDFs. And if I want to add a document to that cloud library, for instance, one of my download stack, I can just drag it right in. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s available across all of my devices.
Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to launch pages, and I\xe2\x80\x99m working here on a poster, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to open that up. Now it turns out of course because this is in my cloud library that \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s also available to me on my phone, where I also have a copy of pages running. And so here on my phone, I can actually not only view, but also make changes to this document and what I want you to do is watch what happens on the Mac as I actually go in here and go into my photo roll make a change, replace the picture, and the Mac will actually update automatically for me. There it is.
That\xe2\x80\x99s just a little preview of life in Mountain Lion with iCloud. Next is a feature I think you are really going to love Notification Center, it\xe2\x80\x99s coming to the Mac. So sometimes when you are using your Mac, it can decide that it has something to tell you. And in the past each application had its own unique way of getting your attention and some of them were somewhat disruptive.
Well, with Mountain Lion, we\xe2\x80\x99ve replaced all of this with a consistent and elegant system based on Banners and Alerts. So Banners slide down from the top of the screen, right there into the upper right hand corner, and if you ignore them, they just slide out of the way. But you\xe2\x80\x99re going to always get back to them with two figures from the right hand side of your trackpad, you can slide out and reveal Notification Center with notifications from all of your applications, and when you\xe2\x80\x99re down, you just slide it back.
Now Alerts are for things that you want to make sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t miss, so they come in the same elegant way, but they stay around until you dismiss them explicitly. Now sometimes you may be doing something when you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be interrupted by notifications. The Notification Center provides a nice little switch so you can temporarily disable those banners and notifications, and if you are presenting and you connect to a projector, will do it for you automatically. So that\xe2\x80\x99s Notification Center.
Next up, Dictation; we are bringing Dictation to the Mac. So everywhere on your Mac where you can type, you can now talk and the Mac will do the typing for you. And because it\xe2\x80\x99s built into the system, it works everywhere; you can talk into your Facebook webpage if you want or even in third party applications like Microsoft Word. That\xe2\x80\x99s Dictation, it\xe2\x80\x99s that simple.
Next is Sharing. Mac users love to share, links, images, videos, and now in Mountain Lion, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made it easier than ever to share right from within the app where you are working. There is a share button right there in the toolbar, you click it, we present all of your sharing options, if I want to share to Twitter for instance, just select it, get a cute little Tweet Sheet, type whatever it is I find necessary to share with the outside world, click it, and like that, it\xe2\x80\x99s on it\xe2\x80\x99s way.
And we built sharing in across the systems. So if you are in Preview for instance, and you want to share the PDF you are looking at or messages, you can do it. If you are in any app where you can quick look, for instance you quick look into an image, you can post it up, sharing over Flickr.
And our support for sharing is more than skin-deep in Mountain Lion. Support for sharing services like Twitter is build right into the operating system. So when you go into system preferences and enter your login information, enter it just once, and any application you\xe2\x80\x99ve authorized can access and connect to those social services. So that\xe2\x80\x99s Sharing.
Next is the new Safari. The new Safari in Mountain Lion has the fastest JavaScript engine of any browser on the planet. But the first thing you will notice when you use Safari is the new unified smart search field. You type in it whatever you are looking for and Safari will present you with a well chosen top hit, yes, this is a very useful feature. Search suggestions and even matches automatically from your bookmarks and your browsing history.
Now sometimes what you are looking for is something that you were browsing earlier maybe on one of your other devices. Well, now, Safari has a feature called iCloud Tabs. You just click the cloud button on your toolbar and you get a list of all of the pages you have open across all of your other devices including your Macs. You just click it and you pick up your browsing right where you left off.
Now we also have a fantastic new feature, we call TabView, it lets you use gestures to visually navigate your tabs. I would like to show it to you now. So let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at the new Safari, you can see of course we have our unified search field right here at the top, I can type a few characters and Safari presents me with the top hit, as well as search suggestions and bookmark and history matches. You can click, we get some Safari\xe2\x80\x99s lightning fast page loading. Safari also has a new scrolling architecture built on core animation, which makes scrolling just smooth and lightning fast, it\xe2\x80\x99s really awesome.
Now, if you want to open a tab that you had opened for instance on another computer, I can just click the iCloud Tabs button you see all of them right there, documents I\xe2\x80\x99d opened my iPad as well as on my iPhone, I click one, I can keep browsing right from where I left off.
Now, Lion has a feature where of course you can use multi-touch gestures to zoom in on your webpage. So for instance, zoom in like this you can zoom back out, but now what happens when I zoom even further out, watch, I am pulled into the TabView, where I have a live view across all of my tabs, I can use multi-touch gestures to scroll through them, select a tab, pinch and back out, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fantastic way to browse your tabs in Safari.
Next, I want to show you how easy it is to share in Mountain Lion, you can select here in the share button, let say I want to tweet about this page, I click, get this beautiful little animation, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say heading down the coast, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve sent a tweet on its way. But sharing works really well also in full-screen apps for instance I\xe2\x80\x99ll just pan over here to full-screen iPhoto. Let\xe2\x80\x99s open up a photo that I want to share and I want to share this to iMessage, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to leave this full-screen experience to do that. I click on the system-wide share button, select messages and I get a little messaging sheet, right here I select the person I want to send to and just like that I have sent a message.
Now this is where Notification Center comes in because if I am working in a full-screen app and maybe someone responds back to that message I send back out, it will actually appear as a notification right there on my screen, there it is. And if I ignore it, of course it will just slide away, but if I want to get back to it that\xe2\x80\x99s easy too, I take two fingers from the right hand side of my trackpad and I can just sweep out notification center, it\xe2\x80\x99s completely fluid gesture. And if I want to get at any of these things, I can click for instance on this message and it takes me right to the conversation back in messages.
Now notifications also support notifications from Internet services like Twitter, so if I get a Twitter direct mentioned - direct message or mentioned, it will come in as a notification for me. And if I ever want to tweet at anytime, some bright idea occurs to me, I can just go right into notification center and I then can summon a Tweet sheet right here and of course I can use dictation to enter my Tweet. Having a great time showing off Mountain Lion at WWDC and there it is, tweeting from notifications tab.
So next I want to introduce you to a new technology in OS X, that we call Power Nap, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great name, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? So you know, we all love using our Macs, but wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be great if when we weren\xe2\x80\x99t using them they were still working for us. Well now with Power Nap they will, because Power Nap keeps your Mac up to date while it sleeps, it fetches your email, keeps track of calendar and reminder updates and even fetches your photo stream.
And it gets better, if you ever brought your Mac home and just plugged it into charge for the night, well now it will also back itself up to your time capsule and even download App Store and system software updates automatically. Power nap automatically refreshes data, its operation is entirely silent, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even spin up your fans, it goes easy on your battery and it\xe2\x80\x99s compatible with the recent MacBook Airs, as well as that gorgeous new MacBook Pro with Retina display, that\xe2\x80\x99s Power Nap.
Next is AirPlay Mirroring. AirPlay Mirroring, yes, AirPlay Mirroring is absolutely the easiest way to get whatever is on your Mac up on a projector or television. You just go up to your Mac to the AirPlay menu in your Mac menu bar, shows you any Apple TVs that are nearby, you select one and instantly you are mirroring that content and up to pixel for pixel 1080p resolution. This is fantastic for the classroom, for the meeting room, of course for your family room and we also support sending audio to AirPlay enabled stereo receivers and speakers, that\xe2\x80\x99s AirPlay, and finally, it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be really nice.
And finally Game Center, you know with the introduction of the Mac App Store, we\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced a renaissance of gaming on the Mac and we\xe2\x80\x99re making it even better by bringing Game Center from iOS to the Mac. And with Game Center on the Mac, you have your same Game Center account with all of your Game Center friends where you can track all your achievements and also keep track of all your games both iOS X and iOS games. But of course the Game Center is ultimately all about gaming and we support both turn-based and head-to-head gaming both Mac to Mac and cross platform iOS to Mac over Game Center.
I would like to give you a little demo of AirPlay and Game Center now. So the first thing I would like to do is show my Mac screen and then lets also summon my Apple TV, as you can see that as well. And you will notice up here on my Mac\xe2\x80\x99s menu bar, I have an AirPlay menu and I can select this Apple TV, when I select it instantly my Mac display is mirrored to the Apple TV in 1080p. Now the rest of this demo is going to be viewing this content entirely over AirPlay. Of course I can do anything I would normally do on my Mac when I am on AirPlay, for instance launch Game Center. And here I see my Game Center account, as well as all of my, yeah \xe2\x80\x93 as well as all my, yeah, like I chose that right. And I can also see all of my Game Center friends, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got one here Mr. X, who is been meaning to play me in this new game that\xe2\x80\x99s coming out called a CSR Racing. So we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can summon him to the stage for a little competition.
Okay. This is looking a little more serious than I was anticipating. So Mr. X here is actually working on an iPad, and on his iPad, he can invite me to play this game CSR Racing, which is an upcoming title from NaturalMotion, and when he does you notice I get of course a notification in Notification Center, I click on it and I\xe2\x80\x99m instantly launched into the game. Now, NaturalMotion was originally developing this just as an iOS title, but they found it so easy to bring it to the Mac and integrate Game Center, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be simultaneously releasing it for iOS and Mac this summer. All right, it looks like we are up for race I\xe2\x80\x99m in the red, racer OS X on the right in white. Here we go.
Again this is over AirPlay everything you are seeing, let go. All right, I think I got you. Well, I guess with an outfit like that he was sure to win.
Okay, so this is just a quick overview of Mountain Lion, and in addition to these major features there is so much more there, things like VIPs in mail where you can mark any people that are important to you and new incoming messages will show up as notifications for you. Search in Launchpad, Gatekeeper to help keep your system free from malware and offline reading list or in Safari, if you add things to your reading list, you can still read them later even when you are disconnected from the Internet. But one area I want to highlight especially are some features we\xe2\x80\x99re adding for China, the Mac has been growing fantastically in China and we have some wonderful features that we think that are going to make it even more popular there. We are really improving our Chinese input method for pin yin, we are providing a new Chinese dictionary, we are adding eight new fronts that are great for creating beautiful documents.
In Safari, we are adding support for Baidu, as an optional search provider and adding sharing support for the Sina microblogging website, as well as video sharing to Youku and Tudou. And finally we are making it really easy to set up your Mac with China\xe2\x80\x99s top email services. So those were a few features for China, but of course yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be important, get your apps ready for China.
So Mountain Lion is also a fantastic release for developers with over 1,700 new APIs, so you can add sharing, Game Center support, notification support, new high DPI APIs and gesture APIs to add those great multi-touch swipes to your apps. So Mountain Lion, we are going to be delivering it to customers next month via the Mac app store. And you know well Lion was priced I think very aggressively at $29.99, we want even more people to get their hands on Mountain Lion, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be just $19.99. And this price is for upgrades both from Lion and all the way from Snow Leopard and your single purchase will upgrade all of your personal Macs.
Finally for those of you who buy a new Mac starting today, I think that there are going to be a few, your upgrade to Mountain Lion will be free and all of you WWDC developers, today you get access to a near final developer preview, so you can get all your apps ready for Mountain Lion when it ships next month, that\xe2\x80\x99s Mountain Lion. Thank you.
Next up I\xe2\x80\x99d like to hand it over to Scott Forstall to give you an update on iOS.
Scott J. Forstall
All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about iOS. I find it incredible that through the end of March we\xe2\x80\x99ve already sold more than 365 million iOS devices. And what I find almost equally amazing is that more than 80% of our customers are running the very latest version of iOS, iOS 5. Now if you compare that to the competition, they released their new product 4.0, about the same time that we released iOS 5. And about 7% of Android customers are running the latest version versus more than 80% the latest version of iOS, iOS 5.
Now, let me give you a quick update on a few of the features of iOS 5 that made it a great release, starting with Notification Center. Already 84 of the top 100 social apps are pushing notifications. In fact, we\xe2\x80\x99re sending around 7 billion push notifications every single day. We have already sent more than 1.5 trillion, that is trillion, first time I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this number up here, more than 1.5 trillion push notifications already, it\xe2\x80\x99s just amazing, Notification Center.
Next is iMessage. We have more than a 140 million iMessage users, they\xe2\x80\x99ve sent more than a 150 billion messages and are currently sending more than a 1 billion messages every single day.
Next is Twitter. We integrated Twitter directly into iOS 5 and they\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen a three times growth increase from the number of people on iOS using Twitter. Those customers have sent more than 10 billion Tweets from iOS 5 and nearly half of all the photos being shared with Twitter\xe2\x80\x99s photo sharing service come from iOS 5. So great integration.
Next is Game Center. Game Center is a great gaming network. We have more than a 130 million people using it. They submit 5 billion scores every single week and two thirds of the top 100 games integrate with Game Center. And all of this result in some very, very satisfied customers. More than 75% of our customers check the top box from very satisfied compared to less than 50% for the competition.
Now, one of the reasons that our customers are so satisfied is that every single year since the original iPhone, we come out with a new OS full of great quality, amazing features and this year\xe2\x80\x99s no exception, so I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy to announce iOS 6. iOS 6 is a fantastic release. It has more than 200 new features, starting with some significant enhancements to Siri. I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk you through a few, let\xe2\x80\x99s start with Siri.
As you all know Siri has only been out for eight months and already does so much for you. It can send text messages, get all sorts of answers, set alarms, find out about the weather, make phone calls, create a reminder for kids, if you\xe2\x80\x99re my kids you can just chat with it for a while, Siri is fantastic. But in these eight months Siri has been studying up and learning a lot more. So let me just go ahead and show you what Siri can do now in iOS 6.
So here I have a phone running iOS 6. The first thing that Siri has learned in last eight months is all about sports. So you can ask questions like, what was the score of the last Giants game?
Siri
The Giants were downed by the Rangers yesterday; the final score was 5 to 0.
Scott J. Forstall
So this looks great, we got this great scoreboard, I have to say I like the scores against Texas little better during the World Series, but great sports scores ask of Siri. You can also ask about individual players like this: What is Buster Posey\xe2\x80\x99s batting average?
Siri
Buster Posey has a batting average of.290.
Scott J. Forstall
So you can see, you get player cards and player stats. It\xe2\x80\x99s very cool. You can also ask about standings. What are the National League standings?
Siri
Here are the standings for the National League.
Scott J. Forstall
So you scroll down here and see the Giants there in second place. So Siri knows about baseball. Siri also knows about basketball. So I can ask, who is taller, LeBron or Kobe?
Siri
LeBron James appears to be slightly taller.
Scott J. Forstall
So we see this player card, there is LeBron James who is 6\'8", if I scroll down to Kobe\xe2\x80\x99s card 6\xe2\x80\x996\xe2\x80\x9d. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s not football season right now, but Siri also knows about football, so I can ask, when is the San Francisco 49ers first game of the season?
Siri
The 49ers \xe2\x80\x93 Packers game is September 9, 2012, 1:15 PM.
Scott J. Forstall
So the entire schedule right there. It\xe2\x80\x99s just awesome. So Siri knows about sports. Next up, Siri has learned a lot more about restaurants. So I can ask, find a great place for dinner.
Siri
I found 15 restaurants. 14 of them are fairly close to you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve sorted them by rating.
Scott J. Forstall
So you can see we have a lot more information about restaurants now, the average price of menu item, the type of restaurant. If I go ahead and choose one of these, I\xe2\x80\x99ll choose Millennium. You can see all sorts of information about the restaurant. We have maps here. We\xe2\x80\x99ve partnered with Yelp. So you can see reviews right in here, tap on that and here is the reviews. And if you want even more information just tap on any of these reviews and it will take you right to the Yelp app from the App Store.
I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also partnered with OpenTable. So I can tap here to make reservations, takes me again to the OpenTable app right from the App Store, can choose a date, number of people and make a reservation, it\xe2\x80\x99s that easy. So Siri knows a lot about restaurants now.
Next up, Siri\xe2\x80\x99s become something of a movie buff. So you can ask also sorts of questions like, what movies are playing at the Metreon?
Siri
Okay. I found eight movies at the Metreon.
Scott J. Forstall
So I can tell you what movies are playing, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go ahead and choose one, Marvel\xe2\x80\x99s The Avengers. You see we\xe2\x80\x99ve integrated with Rotten Tomatoes, so you can see ratings and reviews. You can even tap to watch the trailer right here in Siri.
[Video Playback]
So really, really cool. You can also ask questions about directors or actors, so I can say, show me movies starring Scarlett Johansson.
Siri
I found several movies starring Scarlett Johansson.
Scott J. Forstall
So to find current movies in the theater, as well as, previous catalog, just fantastic. Let me show you one more thing Siri has learned and that is how to launch apps. So now, you\xe2\x80\x99ve all been creating incredible apps, now it\xe2\x80\x99s so easy to get to them, if you are like me I have hundreds of apps in my phone. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say, I want to play a game, I can just ask Siri now. Play Temple Run and it\xe2\x80\x99s just like that. And those are just a few of the things that Siri has learned in iOS 6.
So before Siri did so much, but now, it\xe2\x80\x99s just incredible, sports scores, you can ask for football scores or basketball both pro and college, you can ask for baseball, hockey, also soccer and we do a lot of the leagues including the English Premiere League. So sports scores. You can ask about movies, you can launch apps, make dinner reservations, you can now Tweet just by talking to your phone and there is this thing we\'re calling Eyes Free.
Now, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of Hands Free before, Hands Free allows you to keep your hands on the steering wheel while you use your phone. We want to integrate Siri even better with the car. And so we\xe2\x80\x99re working with a number of car manufacturers to enable to use a button, right on the steering wheel to bring up Siri. Now since Siri can talk back to you, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need and we don\xe2\x80\x99t light up the screen of the iPhone, so you can keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road and use Siri. Now a number of auto manufacturers have already committed to delivering Eyes Free Siri integration in the next 12 months.
We\xe2\x80\x99re also taking Siri much more international. When we launched Siri, we launched it in English in the United States, Great Britain, Australia and we had French and German, recently we added Japanese. And now in iOS 6, we\xe2\x80\x99re adding English and French tune for Canada. We\xe2\x80\x99re adding Spanish tune for Spain, Mexico and the United States. We were adding Italian. For Switzerland, we\xe2\x80\x99re adding Italian, French and German. We\xe2\x80\x99re adding Korean, 60 countries represented here. We\xe2\x80\x99re adding Mandarin, tune for Taiwan, Cantonese tune for Hong Kong and both Mandarin and Cantonese tune for Mainland, China.
Now as part of making Siri more international, we\xe2\x80\x99re now taking local search which was U.S. only in iOS 5 around the world. So you can now do local search even in China and for the first time we\xe2\x80\x99re taking Siri beyond the iPhone 4S, we\xe2\x80\x99re bringing it to the new iPad. And these are just a few of the enhancements for Siri in iOS 6.
Next, Facebook integration. We have been working very closely with Facebook to create the best Facebook experience ever on a mobile device. We are integrating Facebook right in to iOS 6, you can now go to the settings app and enter your username and password and now you are ready to go. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to re-log in when you go to an app from the App Store, including Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s app.
We\xe2\x80\x99re also making it really easy to post a Facebook from many of our apps. So you can post photos from the Photos App, post about websites from Safari, post locations from maps, you can talk about your favorite app, your own app in this case, from the App Store. You can talk about movies, TV shows, and movies from the iTunes Store, you can talk some smack from the Game Center. We\xe2\x80\x99ve also integrated it right in with Notification Center. So anywhere you are just drag your finger down from the top of the screen to reveal Notification Center and you can tap to post to Facebook, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve added Twitter right into Notification Center as well.
We\xe2\x80\x99ve also integrated Facebook with Siri, so you can just talk to your phone now to post to Facebook. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken this deep integration and made it a public API, so it\xe2\x80\x99s easy for apps on the App Store to integrate with Facebook. But we didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop there. We\xe2\x80\x99ve also integrated it with the App Store.
So now you can like apps and see which apps your friends like. And you can also do that for the iTunes Store with music, TV shows and movies. And if your friends are sharing say a phone number or an e-mail address from Facebook, those will appear in your contact list now, right on your iPhone and your iOS devices. Also your Facebook events will now appear in calendars along with birthdays. So we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a deep integration of Facebook right into iOS 6 and we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken that same integration and brought it to the Mac. And that is Facebook integration.
Next are some really nice enhancements to the Phone app. Now, you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably been in a meeting before where you receive a phone call, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t answer it right then. And you wish it was easy to quickly text a message back to the person or be reminded to call them back later. On iOS 6, there is a new control on the right hand side of the incoming call and if you slide that up you get two new options, you can reply with a message or be reminded to call the person back later.
If you choose reply with a message, just tap then on any of these buttons will send a text message or an iMessage right to the caller and if you choose remind me later, you can be reminded in a hour, my favorite actually is the second one, remind me when I leave that will set up a geo-fence around your current location, so when you leave the meeting or leave the building, your phone will pop up an alert reminding you to call that person back. So remind me later.
Next up is something we\xe2\x80\x99re calling Do Not Disturb. Now, I can see many of you are like me and you\xe2\x80\x99ve been awakened in the middle of the night by a text message or a push notification or an unwanted phone call. And Do Not Disturb allows you to tell your phone not to bother you with such interruptions. Now those push notifications and text messages, they\xe2\x80\x99ll still come to your phone; it just won\xe2\x80\x99t light up the screen or make a sound to wake you up. They will be there for you in the morning.
Now you also with Do Not Disturb get fine-grained control over which phone calls you receive. So you can choose to receive no phone calls at all or just phone calls from your favorites or from a group that you create in your contact list. And if you choose this last setting here, repeated calls, if someone really wants to get a hold of you and they\xe2\x80\x99re persistent and they call you back within three minutes because it\xe2\x80\x99s an emergency that second call will come through, so some great enhancements to the phone app.
Next is FaceTime. FaceTime is the best way to have a video conference with someone. But there is one catch it only works over WiFi, so what happens if you\xe2\x80\x99re somewhere where there isn\xe2\x80\x99t WiFi, On iOS 6 we\xe2\x80\x99re enabling FaceTime over cellular. So if you have either a WiFi or a cellular data connection, you can have a FaceTime call.
Also, we\xe2\x80\x99re unifying your phone number and your Apple ID. So if some one, somebody already knows what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen? So if some one calls you on your phone number with a FaceTime call, you can answer that call on your iPad or even your Mac. And we\xe2\x80\x99re doing the exact same thing with iMessage. So if someone sends an iMessage to your phone number, you can receive that and reply on your iPad or your Mac. And that\xe2\x80\x99s FaceTime.
Next up is Safari. Safari is the best and the most popular mobile web browser on the planet. About two-thirds of all mobile web traffic comes from Safari on iOS and we are making it even better. As you heard earlier, we\xe2\x80\x99re adding iCloud Tabs. So from say your iPad, you can see all the Safari windows and tabs that are opened on any of your other iOS devices or your Macs. We\xe2\x80\x99re also adding offline reading list.
So in iOS 5 we added reading list, which is the great way for you to save a story, a web story way to read it later. And now as soon as you add it to the reading list will download and cache the story. So you can go and read that even if you later don\xe2\x80\x99t have Internet connectivity. We\xe2\x80\x99re also adding the ability to upload photos right from Safari to your favorite websites. We\xe2\x80\x99re adding something we call Smart App Banners.
Now a lot of you have built great apps that are in the App Store and you also have websites. With Smart App Banners, if someone goes to your website Safari can optionally put up a banner letting them know about your native app in the App Store. Tapping this, so tapping that banner takes them right to the store to download your app.
And if they\xe2\x80\x99ve already installed your app and they happen to come upon your website, well tapping on that will just switch right to your App Store app and the website can even tell the app what the person was doing on the website, so they can pickup in the app right where they left off on the website, really cool. We\xe2\x80\x99re also adding full screen supports in landscape on the iPhone to take full advantage of the large Retina display. Some great Safari features.
Next up is Photo Stream. Photo Stream is one of the really nice free features in iCloud. It is the best way to get all of your photos to all of your devices, iOS devices and your Macs. And now on iOS 6 we\xe2\x80\x99re adding Shared Photo Streams. Now Shared Photo Streams is a really easy way for you to share photos with your friends. It\xe2\x80\x99s really simple, just choose the photos you like to share, choose the friends with whom you like to share them and that\xe2\x80\x99s it, you\xe2\x80\x99re done. Your friends will receive a push notification with those photos, the photos will appear in an album right in the photos app and you and your friends can all even comment on the photos.
In addition to iOS Shared Photo Streams go to your Mac with iPhoto and Aperture, you can view them in a web browser on a Windows and you can even view them on your television using Apple TV. And that is Shared Photo Streams.
Next are some great enhancements to mail, starting with VIPs. VIP allows you to mark some one whose messages you really want to be notified about. So once you mark some one as a VIP and they send you an e-mail, you get a notification right in the lock screen of that e-mail the same way you would for a text message. It\xe2\x80\x99s also really easy to find messages from your VIPs when you are looking at message list, they have a star next to them and we\xe2\x80\x99ve added a VIP mailbox, which gathers together all of those messages from your VIPs. And for those of you who like to flag messages, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also added a flagged mailbox as well.
We\xe2\x80\x99ve also made it really easy for you to insert photos and video right in the compose window and you can now open password protected Office docs right on your iOS device. And as last one, we added a fun new animation to pull and refresh your message list. So some great features for mail.
Next up is a brand new app we\xe2\x80\x99re calling Passbook. Now Passbook is the simplest way to get all of your passes in one place. There are a lot of really great apps in the App Store that are starting to put passes, boarding passes and tickets into the apps. There are some airline apps, like this one from United, where you get your boarding pass right in the app.
There are some store card apps like this one from Starbucks, where you get the store card right in the app and you can use it to scan and pay for your coffee. And there are some movie ticket apps like this one where your movie ticket goes right into the app. And that was just great, but the problem is when you get to the movie theatre or to the airport, you have to fumble around to find the app and then find the ticket or the pass within the app.
So Passbook takes all of these passes and combines them together in one place and integrates it right into the OS and they\xe2\x80\x99re beautiful. Here is a movie ticket from Fandango, we\xe2\x80\x99ve created templates to make it really easy for all of you developers to build these great passes and tickets and it integrates right into the lock screen. So when you get to the movie theatre, your ticket automatically pops up on the lock screen, slide across here, scan it in, go in.
Let me go ahead and give you a quick demo of Passbook. All right, so here is Passbook, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some tickets, so here is a Fandango ticket for a movie, again these are beautiful, have a nice ticket for Giants game here. We have store cards, here is a card for Starbucks and then you can see has the balance there, when you use this to scan and pay for your coffee, the balance automatically gets updated.
Here is a store card for the Apple Store. We have boarding passes, here is one for Amtrak, and here are a couple for United Airlines and again we have two we grouped them together, here is a coupon for Target, here is an Express checking card for hotel. Now when you\xe2\x80\x99re done with a card just flip it over there is a trash can at the top-left and we had a little bit of fun with this deleting your cards.
Now as I said, this is all integrated in with the phone and with the lock screen. So if I have my phone locked, and I go to my favorite Starbucks up comes my Starbucks Card. Slide across it, brings up my card, scan, pay for my coffee, and I\xe2\x80\x99m out, so that easy. And all these cards are actually live, so if my gate changed, it\xe2\x80\x99s got an update for my United Airlines gate change, it comes up I slide across here, there is my boarding pass updated, right in the app. So that is Passbook. The best way to get all of your passes, tickets together in one place.
Next is Guided Access. We set out to make the most accessible devices of anyone for all of our customers. And we\xe2\x80\x99re really proud of how the accessibility community has been adopting iOS devices. Now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been surprised by the number of children with autism who have been flocking to our devices, especially our iPads. And we want to make that experience even better.
There are a lot of great apps on the App Store like this one that are designed specifically for children with autism. The problem is there are some controls, some settings and other controls in the app that you don\xe2\x80\x99t want the child to tap while they\xe2\x80\x99re using the app. So Guided Access allows you just circle those controls with your finger, we\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out which ones you mean and we\xe2\x80\x99ll disable those controls for you. The child now can use the app without accidentally hitting those. And we lock the device into a single app mode, so hitting the home button doesn\xe2\x80\x99t leave the app.
Guided Access is great. It allows children with autism to learn independently on their iPad. Now this is great beyond children with autism. It\xe2\x80\x99s really single app mode and single app mode has a lot of applications. There are a lot of schools who\xe2\x80\x99ve been adopting iPads and some are starting to actually administer tests on their iPads. Well single app mode allows the teacher to lock that iPad into the test so the students can\xe2\x80\x99t go look up the answers in Safari. And this also works great for museums who use iPads and iPod touches for guided tours, so single app mode in Guided Access.
Next is Maps, in iOS 6, we have built an entire new mapping solution from the ground up and it is beautiful. This is what Lake Tahoe looks like, we are doing all the cartography ourselves; here is New York City, San Francisco, this is a worldwide effort, we are covering the world, here is Italy, New Zealand, Singapore, Norway, Paris, and I am going to go through every city in the - beautiful, beautiful maps.
Now part of Maps is local search, you have to be able to find businesses and points of interest and so we have already ingested more than 100 million business listings around the world to make a great local search. Once you find a business, bring up the info card and it\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful. We have integrated with Yelp, so you get reviews and ratings, and lots of photos right in the card. We are also building a traffic service. We have this great traffic view, so it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see where the incidents or where the slow traffic is. And on top of that, we overlay the incidents, so it\xe2\x80\x99s easier for you to figure out whether traffic is likely to speed up in a given location anytime soon.
In addition to other data sources we are using anonymous real-time crowd sourced data right from our iOS users, to keep this traffic fresh and up-to-date. We are also building in turn-by-turn navigation. So it\xe2\x80\x99s really simple, once you find a place you like to go just tap on that Quick Route button and you\xe2\x80\x99re on your way. As you are going, we\'ll be monitoring the traffic, we will give you your ETA. If the traffic slows down, in front of you we will update your ETA and they will start looking to reroute you around it to find a faster route. And if we do we\xe2\x80\x99ll offer it to you and again you are on your way around the traffic.
All of this works from the lock screen as well, if you have plugged in your car. And of course, we\xe2\x80\x99ve integrated it with Siri, so you just ask Siri to take you somewhere and you\xe2\x80\x99re on your way. You can ask questions along your route, like where can I get gas and it\xe2\x80\x99ll look for convenient gas stations along your route and of course the kids can ask the age old question.
Now a really fun feature that we\xe2\x80\x99re adding to our Maps is something we call Flyover. We have been flying major metropolitan areas around the world in helicopters and in planes and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been building up a 3D photographic model of these places and it is gorgeous. This is what it looks like on the iPhone, looks great on the iPad, let me just go ahead and give you a demo of our maps.
All right, so here is our maps, they are all vector based so everything is really fast to zoom in and out, you can rotate, you can rotate all the labels, when you zoom in far enough you\xe2\x80\x99ll see building start to appears, you can tap on point of interest here is MoMA, get the info card, again beautiful, get reviews and ratings from Yelp, lots of photos. We also do 3D. So I can zoom in and see just what MoMA looks like. Zoom out a little bit here, sort of move around the city, rotate around, zoom back in there beautiful, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to 2D. We have a satellite view of course, here is our satellite view.
But what I really want to show you is Flyover. Just go ahead and choose the Transamerica Pyramid. Now, this is not a movie. This is being rendered in real-time, so I can go ahead and rotate this myself, I can change the camera angle, fly through it myself, just beautiful; let me choose another place, how about the Sydney Opera House and again I can rotate this, let\xe2\x80\x99s turn it so I can look back at the city, right behind the Opera House, I will zoom out a little bit, change the camera angle. And that is Flyover.
Now the last thing I\xe2\x80\x99d like to show you is turn-by-turn directions. So let\xe2\x80\x99s switch to the other device, we can\xe2\x80\x99t all go and get in the car and drive around, so we have a simulator for turn-by-turn directions here. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go ahead and choose Coit Tower. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tap on the Quick Route button, it gives me three different options, I\xe2\x80\x99ll choose Route 2. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go ahead and start.
Siri
Starting route to Coit Tower, in 750 feet turn right onto Greenwich Street, then turn left onto Grant Avenue.
Scott J. Forstall
Now you can watch this adaptive cinematic camera angles as we go through corners.
Siri
In 400 feet, turn left onto Grant Avenue.
Scott J. Forstall
When two turns are close together we put both signs up for you.
Siri
In 300 feet, turn right onto Lombard Street.
Scott J. Forstall
You can see we have the footprint of all these buildings correct.
Siri
In a quarter mile arrive at your destination.
Scott J. Forstall
Now at any point I can get the ETA up top, it says one minute, simulator is going a lot faster than you should drive in San Francisco, we will get there faster. I can also just tap on overview, which allows me to zoom out, I can see any part of the route in any time, zoom in over here to sort of pan around or at any point just tap to resume. You see coming around Telegraph Hill here.
Siri
Arrived at Coit Tower.
Scott J. Forstall
And that is turn-by-turn directions. So a brand new mapping solution from the ground up in iOS 6. And these are only 10 of the more than 200 new user features in iOS 6. There were so much more in here. There are Game Center challenges, so now if you hit an achievement or a high score it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to challenge your friends to try to beat you. We\xe2\x80\x99ve improved the privacy controls, so you can manage whether an app has access your contacts, calendar, or photos. We\xe2\x80\x99ve completely redesigned the stores, making those gorgeous and fluid and better promote your apps. 
We\xe2\x80\x99re working on made for iPhone hearing aids. We want the experience of people with hearing aids to be the best it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been on an iPhone. We\xe2\x80\x99ve added per-account signatures in mail, so if you have a personal mail account and a work mail account, you can have different signatures for each. We\xe2\x80\x99ve added Lost Mode to find my iPhone, so if you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost or misplaced your iPhone or iPad, or your iPhone in this case, you can send a phone number directly to that phone, like your home phone number or your spouse\xe2\x80\x99s phone number. And now if someone finds it, they can just tap on there, and it will call that phone number back making it that much easier for you to get your phone back. And all those features you heard about for China, for OS X, we\xe2\x80\x99ve added all of these to iOS 6 as well.
So iOS 6 is a phenomenal release for our customers, it is also an incredible release for all of our developers. We continue to strive to build the best platform on the planet for developers. There\xe2\x80\x99s APIs for Pass Kit, so all those passes you saw for passbook are really simple to build with that API, there\xe2\x80\x99s a reminders API, we have in-app content purchases. So if your app today links out say to iTunes to buy music that someone heard in your app, you can now sell that music right in your app with an in-app content purchase sheet.
Transit apps; when building maps we looked around and realized the best transit apps for metros, for hiking, for biking are coming from our developers. And so instead of trying to build those ourselves, we are going to integrate and feature and promote your apps for transit right within the maps app in iOS 6.
So iOS 6 is a great release for all of our developers, and we are giving out a beta of iOS 6 to our developers today. iOS 6 will ship this fall, it will support the iPhone 3GS and later, the second and third generation iPad and the fourth generation iPod touch. And that is iOS 6.
Now I\xe2\x80\x99d like to turn it back over to Tim. Thank you.
Timothy D. Cook
