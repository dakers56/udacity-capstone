Terence Whalen
My name is Terence Whalen and I am Citi\xe2\x80\x99s Semi Cap Equipment analyst. It\'s a pleasure to have Applied Materials here today. With us speaking for Applied Materials is Bob Halliday, CFO. The format that we have today is fire-side chat format. I am not sure to allow plenty of time for audience question as well.
Maybe if we can kick it off, Bob, welcome. So lets say I see there\xe2\x80\x99s an inflection going on in both the foundry space and the memory space and they play to AMAT strength in certain ways that are different competitors of yours. I wanted to just hear your view on how well positioned you are for both the memory technology inflections you see in the foundry technology inflections?
Bob Halliday
That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. I think there\xe2\x80\x99s probably more technology inflections going on right now than in years. If you look at it for years customers memory and foundry logic, they continue to follow the road map primarily by shrinking in two dimensions of planar shrink. So they just make small and small devices including the gate. They are running out of steam amount in terms of technology and commercial. So the way to relieve that pressure to a certain logic sense to go vertically, go into a third dimension.
So if you look at Logic devices what they are doing is going into things call FinFET where the Fin is like the fin under a fish, it\xe2\x80\x99s vertical and what the going vertical in Logic does it gives you more surface area, so you can do contacting and device performance study. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have leakage problems to face, because the heart of device is plane and you have a gate, you got all sorts of leakage problems.
Leakage of drive current you don\xe2\x80\x99t have is good a speed device, but also leakage of power, so your battery dies. These are really big things as you think about more mobile devices, because the battery dies, it gets hot or your speeding devices is bad. So leakage control is a really big deal and you really can\xe2\x80\x99t you are running out of tools to manage it by going in two dimensions, we are going in third dimension relieves that pressure.
Now what they going to do with Logic, is they going to go to FinFET which Intel has already done and TSMC and Samsung in particular have aggressive roadmaps to achieve. That technology if you look at the devices for FinFET is very powerful in terms of both power consumption and processing speed. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s also very powerful for a company like Applied Materials, because if you look at how they make those fins. Some of the tools that they buy extensively are things like EPI tool, Epitaxial growth because to grow on the side of a fin especially things like contacting you use tools like EPI.
Now the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s really good for us is our share in EPI is very, very high; our differentiation is high; and the tool because you are growing one layer at a time it\xe2\x80\x99s a slow process and you buy a lot of tools. So the inflection to go vertical is an overwhelming need because you can\xe2\x80\x99t shrink [latter] as I said and that\xe2\x80\x99s very good for Applied because you just have to do vertical devices things like EPI and PVD which came in at 28 and 20 nanometer for Metal Gate which again reduces contact resistance and increases performance of device that\xe2\x80\x99s very good for us too. So this vertical inflection is very good.
Now if you think how they are going to continue the roadmap on Fins, they\xe2\x80\x99ll probably go taller and narrower, but then to continue the roadmap they will go to ultimate materials, because if you release some of your roadmap pressure by going vertical you are given the surface area and the other way you can relief your pressure is to go to different materials that are even more conductive or more resistant generally more conductive.
That deposition and [addition] of new material plays very well to us. We are the world leader in depositing different types of material. So if you think about going 3-5 materials which goes materials on the table of elements in the third and the fifth column that\xe2\x80\x99s very powerful for us too, and that\xe2\x80\x99s probably the next step after getting taller that they will fall. So the whole FinFET roadmap is good us if Fin are 20 nanometer 14, 16, 20 and early 28. That\xe2\x80\x99s still like a 35% growth in our (inaudible) particularly around PVD and EPI.
The other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of interesting there is, if you look at the films that we are putting down, the thinner films quality is good. One of the ways they might treat those films make them better is to harden them by heating them and that\'s RTP which we are very strong sharing too. So these inflections in Logic are good for us
If you go to V-NAND, that\'s another really impressive trend going on where NAND has been going shrinking [planar] and they are going to go V-NAND, where they have multiple layers. They can go to any number of layers they have, speculations of all the 32 layers initially and then they can scale to 64. This NAND inflection of V-NAND is very good for customers and also uses of NAND devices for a couple of reasons.
One the technology challenge of continuing to shrink in two dimensions as I said is similar to FinFET is probably worse than NAND. Because if you look at how we make NAND device as they go to multi-level cells and they are down to about 8 electrons per cell. These device are not particularly stable down at that level. So, but if you go and you go vertically, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got much, much stable devices and the lithography challenge, if they continue down that roadmap, you\xe2\x80\x99d be looking at doing a [prospective] with 10 nanometer lithography which is challenging. But if go to V-NAND it might be 50-nanometer lithography.
So that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to do and you can scale vertically and go from 32 to 64 [payers] and you start to get cost, so you can increase your megabit growth very cost effectively. So this is technology enabling to follow their roadmap for NAND devices.
It\'s commercially enabling that you can increase your bit growth by scaling vertically, very cost effective, and it is very good for a company like Applied Materials because of instead of being lithography challenge in two dimensions, where you\'d have to go to 10 nanometer which is very expensive and hard, you start to, it becomes a challenge of etch and deposition. Depositing more layers and etching more. These etches tend to be very tall etches, high aspect ratio etches. That plays very well for Applied as a company because with our performance in etch in high aspect ratio is very good and deposition very good.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Can you kind of put some numbers around what part of the portfolio this addresses? How large a magnitude inflection this could be your semi business?
Bob Halliday
Sure. In FinFETs, which are logic and foundry, around Fin, we think it\'s about 35% growth in our addressable market TAM and our share around the Fins is very strong. You might say well why is Applied\'s share around Fin is very strong. Couple of reasons. One, our technology is very good that, where it\'s EPI, PVD, implants and [RTP] which are the [predom] in etch. But first fall we have very strong share of etch, not as strong around Fin. That is the tools that are growing extensively (Inaudible).
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
What portion of your portfolio is that?
Bob Halliday
So if you look at our higher share and highest revenue market, it tends to be PVD, CVD inplant, RTP and CMP, and CMP is growing there too. So it plays very well to where we are strong share and technology enabling.
The other good thing about the Fins, if you write down at the transistor level there, they are very risk averse of changing because of the process is really tight, it\'s even tighter than backend stuff. So the whole thing plays rest in terms of our technology offerings the growth of adjustable market and sort of this stickiness of technology around it, that\xe2\x80\x99s in the Fins.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Okay.
Bob Halliday
And on VNAND, if you look at this, this could be our growth of 40% to 50% in addressable market, because you\'re putting down all these layers that\xe2\x80\x99s a 32, so if you look at 100,000 wafers stock fab being end and 32 layers that\xe2\x80\x99s about $230 million to $350 million growth in our addressable market. Percentage wise growth in our TAM, I think it\'s about 30% to 40%.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Okay.
Bob Halliday
And those technologies tend to be etch, CVD places of like that.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Okay great. May be you taking a step back and asking about qualitative question, may be just walk us through sort of the evolution of your thinking as you\'ve gotten a closer look internally at Applied Materials over the past year or so. How your thinking has changed specifically around where you have the most (Inaudible) share gain opportunities ?
Bob Halliday
Sure. So first the implied question is to talk about semi, I think we have to do with first view of the company and say what if the markets that are very attractive, that\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing you\'ve got to do on this stuff. So if you look at it the company has disinvested aggressively in the solar market, because the market is not a good market, but I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve cut spending aggressively there and put it into (Inaudible). I think the display, we came in in display market and our position was actually more attractive than we realized.
We\'re gaining share in display, the display market is growing in terms of the size of the market driven by number of TVs, also these TVs are a lot bigger. And if you look at cell phones and tablets those are growing and there maybe technology inflections coming particularly in the low end, the smaller screen sizes which play for us and grow our addressable market.
So when we looked markets solar, a tough market, disinvest display pretty good market strong position gaining share technology inflections play for us, we kind of like this play better than we realize because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know display markets well. Within semi, which I think is certainly, your implicit first question, the big TAMs we didn\xe2\x80\x99t play were etch and inspection when we looked at those products our inspection product was reasonably, it was pretty good product actually but the qualification of it at the fabs we need to put resources in.
So we put resources in the qualifying more layers at the fab and thus being able to sell more tools, we\'re making pretty good progress on that. Etch was the other big addressable market now when etch historically were pretty good in memory not quite as good on foundry and logic.
So what we\'re doing this year there is spending a lot of time going though the qualification process on foundry and logic and making pretty good progress not finalized, you know, say making good progress and then we\'ve actually gained. We think we\'re gaining share particularly in memory where some of these technology inflections in rapid product introductions we\'re doing are helping us. So I think those are big markets we\'re focused on.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
And so from a very high level do you think you\'re well balanced between memory and foundry in terms of capturing the opportunity in terms of the 3D inflections are thus -- are you much stronger in one than the other?
Bob Halliday
That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you ever feel you\'re as well positioned as you\'d like. You\'re always running on the treadmill so I think, if we make, if we have a bunch of products in the pipeline that are pretty disruptive, etch, depositions, CVD, and PVD areas. Those products should bode well for us in both markets.
I think the bigger market in the next year or so is probably foundry will continue to be big in logic, foundry logic is similar, I think the biggest growth next year is probably NAND in terms of growth. But I think we\'re probably pretty well positioned in both, I think the share gains are a little bit easier, there sometimes in memory.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Okay. And then if you could quickly remind us what your WFE view is of 13 and any initial 14 thoughts?
Bob Halliday
Sure, we\'ve been -
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Both maybe magnitude and mix?
Bob Halliday
Sure. So on \'13 we\'ve been pretty steady, we\'re I think we\'re down 5% to 10% from 12, next year we\'re up 10% to 20%. If you look at 13 and it\'s been a big foundry year, a most heavily concentrated with the big time with each foundry, it was a little bit heavier in the beginning the year, when they were ramping 28 nanometer production buys. Now it\'s a little smaller in 28 and they\'re getting ready for 20 nanometer buys towards the end of the year, from now right.
And so foundry in terms of year concentrated there, I think segueing foundry into 2014 it looks like a pretty good year, might be spread out a little bit more. I think the rate of change into next year will be determined more in the second half of the year is my guess, I think the rate of change in foundry spending will be determined by the technology transitions. FinFETs are ready whether it\'s foundry, whether it\'s a TSMC or Samsung, I think there\'ll be a lot of pull for FinFET. If FinFETs are late and you could get a longer tail on 28 and 20 nanometer. So I think the technology inflexion drives what they spend and when. My guess is foundry next year is pretty good with a positive bias, which might be realized in the second half.
In terms of NAND, I think it\'s up a bunch next year. I think it\'s planar and V-NAND. You can see some greenfield fabs out there that are pretty big. Samsung and Toshiba places like that. I think Micron we will spend. Some of it will be DRAM technology spending, technology refresh stuff at (inaudible). So the next year\xe2\x80\x99s spending, foundry pretty good, bigger growth, rate of growth in NAND, DRAM, pretty good but more technology refresh weighted versus NAND that\xe2\x80\x99s more green field.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
You guys have obviously been doing a lot of work since you\'ve come from their end. You had an Analyst Day recently. Can you just maybe touch on the high level aspects of your expectations for gross margin improvement, operating margin, the earnings (inaudible) model?
Bob Halliday
Sure. We had an Analyst Day July 08, and we\'ve put 2016 models, put a few up and so it centered around a wafer fab equipment in 2016 of $37 billion and a couple points of wafer fab share, overall wafer fab equipment for various (inaudible). I think we said we\'re up to like 90.9% and last year we were around, I think, on 79 or something like that. So two full points, and then we showed gross margin improvement in type expense managers. So if you look at the piece of the (inaudible), on the expenses, I think we\'ve done a pretty good job for bringing the spending down and moving money to R&D. So I think on expenses, we are pretty good, making pretty good progress on that roadmap on the P&L.
I think on revenue we are doing tactical things right now to gain share, qualifying existing tools, having strong customer relationships. The sustainable share gains will be more qualification in existing tools and more tools coming out of the pipeline. So if you look at it we have a bunch of products in the pipeline that look very disruptive, which start to come out next year. Those tools look well positioned to drive the share gains on the topline.
I think customers [wealth] came in, and we are doing a lot revaluations which are early signals. The question is you got to have the window, the time window, the process window. Right now I think we will, that will drive both the revenue and the gross margin. The other component of gross margin and profitability is the service business and cost to good sold management. I think we had the opportunity to drive down cost of good sold with sourcing and overhead reduction. That started I think that will continue of next two and half years I can see a roadmap that that happens, may be factual reports than emails so I got work on it right.
But I can see that. So I think most inline with the P&L tax and share count and things make sense too. So go from the P&L up share count, tax, operating expenses, all look like they are in line. Cost reduction and cost of good sold is going and the real driver of the revenue line will be the share gains of new products in the next couple of years. I think we are on the path.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Basically on the path, how confident can you be in that gross margin extension plan given continued concentration in spending at the customer level?
Bob Halliday
Yeah. There\xe2\x80\x99s three big things that we\xe2\x80\x99ll do just to (inaudible) on gross margins. One will be do you have disruptive products, that\xe2\x80\x99s the big hitter, because if you have good products it works out pretty well for you and some of the stuff that we have is very [disruptive]. Now if you look at where we have high share with this EPI or PVD or places like that we can [implant] in places like that, we tend to have pretty good gross margins and it\xe2\x80\x99s because we have very strong product offerings. So we incrementally gets stronger product offering and some of those [TAMs] are growing disproportionately through EPI then that\xe2\x80\x99s good for our gross margin mix.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
What\xe2\x80\x99s the timing like on that because obviously we saw just this recent quarter that you reported three weeks ago, we saw pretty radical shift down in SG&A and up in R&D. What\xe2\x80\x99s the timeline and how predictable are the returns on that in terms of getting the new products ahead?
Bob Halliday
Yeah I think they are going come out a little tight, most of them are going to start hitting. So if you look at what we gave you a leading indicator in the call was that our evaluation volume of tools is upto some point next quarter-on-quarter like 30%. So we got customers taking these tools. So if you want to do early indicators, the financial statements are lagging indicators, a leading indicator of finances is market share, indicates revenue and headcount indicates expenses. The leading indicator of market share is D2R, our designed-tool-of-record. The leading indicator of design-tool-of-record is (inaudible) tools and (inaudible) get the right product. So we got the right price coming out of the pipe I think. We are getting [Eval] tools and the customer pull is pretty good. So those are symptomatic that we are going to do pretty well, but we have to go through the process. So towards the end of next year, next 9 to 12 months we will know a lot more.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
I think you had mentioned the FinFET opportunity to us was one of the more attractive elements in the story around foundry spending, because of the game you are involved between Intel, Samsung and TSMC and the confidence that gives us to then sort of that tightening and delivering a pretty intense spending cycle. One of the messages that you provided at your analyst stay was more around the progress that you have made in the memory market with vertical NAND.
You talked a little bit about wins that you had secured for design-tool-of-record and I think alternatively I think [NAND] the following day talked about having a competent position in the production-tool-of-record. Investors I think are looking for a little bit of clarification of the phases of deployment in vertical NAND and where you believe you might actually have more than opportunity to take share.
Bob Halliday
Sure. I think the debate has been, I think that was the big focus. In 2013, I think we are going to gain share in (inaudible), I think we\'re going to gain share in NAND, V-NAND and planar, I think we\'ll be well positioned in some of the big expansions you are talking about.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
And in terms of the timing that you see from a customer perspective between let\'s say an initial (Inaudible) and then a larger commercial deployment, what are you seeing in terms of how that\'s developing into next year. You mentioned that I think on foundry that you think it\'s a little bit more second half than first half for the real strength in capacity spending. Is that the same for the NAND market as well?
Bob Halliday
Yeah. Let me clarify what I meant to say in foundry. I actually think the first half is pretty stronger on foundry spending, yes it has been the last few years, because of the sort of seasonality (inaudible) for [Christmas]. So, I actually think foundry is strong spending in the first half
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Okay
Bob Halliday
When I said is the up so I would guess, most people think next year is flattish, up a little bit on foundry. First half weighted. I think the first half weighted, the opportunity versus foundry I think is beating the flattish up a little bit would be second half. I think you\'ve got a strong first half where the up side is more so.
In terms of the build out on memory, I think some of the NAND stuff you\'re going to see, you\'re going to see production and revenue buys the end of this calendar year, early the next calendar year and then I think you\'re going to see a build out of NAND pretty much around next year. The big Samsung factory in China is eventually going to be, I think 220,000 wafers [starts] some of it at the end of this year and throughout next year and then in to the following year. Toshiba will build out too.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Okay, I just want to make sure that we give audience an opportunity to ask questions. So why don\xe2\x80\x99t we pull around and I\'d ask that you wait for the mic if you have a question.
Bob Halliday
My cousin in the back has a question.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
I think I might have just missed, that you started talking about the three determinants of your gross margin progression.
Bob Halliday
Oh, yeah.
Unidentified Analyst
And we\'ve got the disruptive products, all the way the other two.
Bob Halliday
Yes, I know. I was sort of switch gears on your. The three were the disruptive products really drove the past. They\'re a little bit time sequence. The other one is tactical stuff on cost reductions, which is happening, right and the third one is how much price pressure you\'ve sort of come to with customers right. And the biggest driver, that one is how strong is your product position.
My guess is we will get cost reduction. My guess is the price pressure from customers will be end up being mixed to moderate. So the tiebreaker will probably be the disruptive products.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Just a little different question, can you comment on your balance sheet, do you feel it\'s well situated do you have enough cash on there for the next few years with regard to market for any reason?
Bob Halliday
Sure the balance sheet the working capital stuff we managed pretty well CapEx is not too big for our industry cash balance is around $3 billion now most of its in U.S. where we\'re free to use it for dividends or buyback. Our industry including Applied seems to be pretty good cash generative because no CapEx is issue, we\'re mostly a working capital issue industry where we ramp up on inventory and receivables. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see us doing too much financing.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Okay. So we have a number of questions here. In terms of share gains specifically, can you walk us through, where you see again sort of the best opportunity and where the timing is on gains in particularly etch?
Bob Halliday
I think the qualification process on foundry and etch has made really good progress this year, some incremental sales, I think the bigger share gain opportunities first this year and next in answer tend to be more memory related.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Okay.
Bob Halliday
Flash more, because Flash is spending more, if you look at Flash and DRAM spending, they\'re little bit different, I think I touched on this earlier today, Flash is more Greenfield, more etch-centric, more capacity wise, related to Greenfield.
DRAM is more technology wise probably little bit my guess it\'s a little bit more weighted towards lithography stuff. So the opportunity for guys like us tends to be more in NAND and that\xe2\x80\x99s where we\'re realizing it so I think we will gain share in etch in memory particularly in NAND this year and next.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Okay great. And then kind of switching gears here one of the big updates from the earnings call was the transition between Gary Dickerson to CEO and Mike Splinter stepping up in that role what\xe2\x80\x99s the significance of that in terms of the company did purchase the solar business in particular.
Bob Halliday
Sure I\'ll talk about generally first of the transition have been going on for about 14-15 months. Gary became President in June of \xe2\x80\x9812 I think there\'s actually been a really good transition, Mike\'s been very supportive, Gary is one of the products which is the solar product semi display services, Mike has had people reporting to like me the CFO, legal and all the functional things manufacturing HR, IT. So now everything reports to Gary so I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been a very smooth transition I think what the primary thing is the company has continued to pick up velocity over the last year in terms of execution speed, redeployment of assets the pace of change is picking up. I think the velocity will continue to pick up.
Gary has got me in meetings every weekend so I assume it\xe2\x80\x99s picking up and so I think velocity will be pick up in terms of the specific question on solar I think we take a very this passionate, analytical view of the markets, I think we have some interesting technology in solar. I think the market is tough right I mean when you have a tough market, what you\'ve got to do you can execute like crazy and the market is tough for a couple of reasons.
One the solar, we sell equipment as a solar manufacturer, solar manufacturers bought way too much equipment back in 2011, they bought probably three or four years worth of equipment. So, if you look at these speculations they don\'t need to buy a lot of capacity equipment for more capacity until I don\'t know, \'14, maybe \'15 in terms of volume.
And then the question is how bigger market is it, because the semi-conductor market a big capacity of vision, but big technology spending too. We don\'t have that same level of technology spending at solar there\'s only you might have hundreds of process steps in semi in total you might have 25 right.
So, the solar market, I think is tougher in terms of spending, because one, they\'ve got too much capacity two, they don\'t have any underpinnings to drive huge spending unless it really takes off. They need a lot of capacity. And some of that I think unnaturally by going up the efficiently curve. So I think solar is a tougher markets, I think we will be very, very judicious in what we do there, we\'ve disinvested aggressively so far. I think we\'ll continue to be very, very careful there.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Okay. Terrific. Another question I had is on what you\'re seeing in terms of tool reuse in very broadly in the industry and is that a risk or is it an opportunity for you?
Bob Halliday
Yeah, it\'s an ongoing theme for years. So if you look at the biggest logic manufacturing, well they don\'t add a lot of greenfield productions, so they do a lot of tool resue and they\'re pretty in-depth at it all right. If you look at memory and foundry the last, while they\'ve been adding volumes of capacity. So it\'s greenfield stuff. If you look at tool reuse, wherever they can, they use but the two things to get there are, one is the capacity adds and two is a new technology.
So as we talked earlier, some of these new technologies like FinFET and [V-NAND] we have a different mix of tools. So you get more EPI tools, you got more [edge] tools, you got more CVD tools. So it\xe2\x80\x99s harder to do to the tool [release] there. That\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit wide to differentiate between NAND and DRAM. DRAM is not adding a lot of capacity, they are adding more technology buys. Green field is more capacity and it plays the tool change and tools both play to us. So I think tool reuse is an ongoing phenomenon but it\xe2\x80\x99s not new.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Okay, and at SEMICON West I think both you and some competitors talked a little bit about the used tool market, that\xe2\x80\x99s a thing that I think a lot of general investors aren\xe2\x80\x99t too aware of. So if you could just give us an update on how significant is that an opportunity or risk to the [green field].
Bob Halliday
That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, I actually think that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of an interesting one. The used tool market isn\xe2\x80\x99t too big right now. People were very concerned around \xe2\x80\x9909, when the overall CapEx wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too big and the power shift (inaudible) was struggling, right, and there is a bunch used tools on the market. Right now it\xe2\x80\x99s a moderate size. I think it is interesting for a couple of levels. One, a lot of used tools are 200 millimeter tools and some day those folks are going to go, and a lot of it\xe2\x80\x99s around analog and CIS device.
So some day those folks are going to go to 300 millimeter size wafers. So kind of don\xe2\x80\x99t want to control those accounts. So rather than have those used tools pass through used tools vendors, you got to have it pass through your self, because one, you have account relationships; two, you have a greater possibility of having spare part sales. I think one of the things we haven\xe2\x80\x99t touched on today which is kind of an interest and you guys particularly want to look at this one. The aftermarket business in [SEMI] industry is very, very powerful. The present value or the appropriate discount rate of cash flow after market are probably north of the equipment sale itself which is to figure out.
So this plays a little bit to the used tool thing too, because if you control that market, you have a great [part] in spare part sales too. So there is three reasons you want to do it. One, you get some sales of equipment; two, you get the aftermarket and a greater [part] really get the aftermarket business. Three, when they upgrade to 300 millimeter fab someday, you are the vendor choice. So I think the used tool market is actually a little bit more of an opportunity than threat at this time.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
Okay, and just one checking again, if we had questions here.
Unidentified Analyst
Can you just say, that you thought on capital allocation priorities and specifically where M&A fits in to that?
Bob Halliday
Sure, right now as I said earlier, we got about $3 billion in cash and that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of what we need, so we increase the dividend through just this quarter, past quarter I think its first time. We\xe2\x80\x99ve increased the last couple of years. So I think the yield on the dividend is about 2.5% which is pretty good for our industry. The buyback we continue to aggressively buy back stock. We got a whole pile of it at the end of \xe2\x80\x9812, and we have been buying back stock the last two quarters. So we are good about returning cash to investors.
In terms of M&A, we don\xe2\x80\x99t specifically ever talk about M&A stuff. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see cash playing into that too much as a factor frankly. I think the [repatriation] of cash for investors is the priority for the company and we will have a mix of those vehicles and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the cash as to predict that one way or the other.
Unidentified Analyst
Would M&A be considered only for SEMI or for other businesses like (inaudible)?
Bob Halliday
I think we are also minded on everything, it\xe2\x80\x99s really to have a good opportunity. So I think we are open mind on everything, but the markets we intend to be the ones we know better.
Unidentified Analyst
And as you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through your product review in the past year, are there any glaring holes in the portfolio or do you feel pretty comfortable that they would just be tuck-in acquisitions there?
Bob Halliday
I think our core products in display in SEMI are pretty darn good. There are certain places where we are trying to get stronger organically. We talked about that in inspection. Other acquisitions of technology is always possible, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t [force] shadow it too much.

Okay, and one other question I have with sort of little bit of a high level qualitative question. Varian was really a one product company from a very high level, and in that obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s much more complex. How does that shift the challenge of your job, and how is that experience (inaudible) last year?
Bob Halliday
Actually a kind of bridged into Applied in a fortuitous manner. I mean if you look at my experience, I was the CFO of Varian, but I was also responsible for manufacturing supply chain and HR, legal, IT all the internal stuff pretty much. So, and I had one finance guy (inaudible) financing. I worked a lot on the operation stuff and strategies stuff, just because I enjoyed it a lot, and then when I became part of the pie, I became the General Manager of Varian from November of \xe2\x80\x9811 affectively May of \xe2\x80\x9911 really, and I got more into the R&D, customer stuff and marketing stuff, right so I was seeing, visiting customers a lot. And I had always gotten into the technology side a reasonable amount, but I got into it deeper.
So from somewhere in \'11 till a few months, six months ago, I was pretty deep in the technology at Varian but engaging with the technology guys to the product management guys and apply, so it peer of the etch guy and CVD guy, PVD guyg working for Randhir who runs SSG. So studying all the people and the product pretty well at Applied.
So I think the transition worked pretty well for me. I think in terms of future transitions but when you make money, you really don\'t think (Inaudible) we are the epitome of a product driven company right, we have really smart customers, just a few of them best product wins and so driving a products is a big deal.
So if I want to trade value for shareholders, it isn\'t anything I\'d do on negotiation pricing terms this week, it\'s do we bet on -- do we allocate on money internally to the right markets, semi and display we\'d like right now. And within that do we allocate it to the right products, we have the rigorous process for doing the resource allocation making sure those products are being executed correctly.
So I spent a disproportionate amount of my time at the front end of that stuff because that\'s where money is because the stuff I do today will impact revenues gross -- the company does stay where in fact revenues gross margins in the next couple of years, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t pay attention to that stuff now doesn\'t matter what I talk to you about the comp is two years from now, because the customers are so big, if you don\'t get the right products that\'s a problem. So we spent a lot of time on that.

And how is the response been to that?
Bob Halliday
Pretty good, I mean.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
I mean, in terms of turnover obviously is a pretty strong cultural shifts going on are we through that initial [adjacency] phase, are things stabilizing really getting going in that process.
Bob Halliday
Which has been a good thing yeah, the product people are being pretty happy I\'d say the last 15 to 20 months because we\'re investing in the product, we\'re going through a lot of review meaning, so they see an obvious interest in drive on the products, Gary and myself, Randhir, everyone. So the product focus people, I think are pretty darn happy in terms of pace investment focus, I think the support people are very supportive because, biggest thing in life, so it\'s three things while you work at the company right, one people love to win winning is a big, big deal, right.
And I think people feel and we can win, we can really win, that\'s a big deal, the second thing, you do interesting things, I mean that\'s the second thing you like in a company. It\'s something to do with really interesting, technologically intellectually challenging. So if you look at that, so that\'s your flow of talent in the company right now which is pretty powerful.
So I think we can win and I think people are excited about it. I think the support organizations, we\'ve been a little bit tougher on spending, so the product guys are pretty happy. The technology guys are, the technical market is pretty happy because a lot of focus on them. The support function is little bit harder task, (Inaudible) whole because we\'re cutting costs there, but I think they really like the we can win part, so that\'s the vision of the company like.

Time for one question, thanks.
Unidentified Analyst
Can you talk about opportunities, back end and -- looking at the packaging I\'ll be semi - tool business, what\'s happened there, and the consortium of companies that they have discussed?
Bob Halliday
The packaging stuff, you\'re not new to this but for years it\'s been voiced as a pretty good opportunity that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really but realized, I think it\'s still a pretty good opportunity that needs to be realized. If you look at semi tool ramps and products in development, that might be incrementally positive there, I would say it\'s an opportunity that still needs to be realized, to be honest with you.
Terence Whalen - Citigroup
