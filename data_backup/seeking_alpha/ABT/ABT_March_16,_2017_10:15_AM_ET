All right. So, we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to get started with our next session here. And we\xe2\x80\x99re really pleased to be joined by management from Abbott Laboratories, including Brian Yoor, who is EVP of Finance and CFO. And Abbott has been our topic for about the six months. We really view this as a story that has a lot of areas that are going to help to improve growth over the next year, driven by products, driven by integration of St. Jude driven by some geographic health in terms of lapping Venezuela and other cities.
I want to -- Brian, just want to get started here. But Brian as a kick off question, Abbott has been really doing a lot to move around and shape the portfolio over the last year. Could you help us understand from a high level what the strategy is, what the goals are, and what some of those moves really bringing at.
Brian Yoor
Sure, Matt. Thank you. So, I think in everything that Abbott is trying to achieve, it\'s important to start with what our identity it\'s all about and that is to be a leader, a diversified leader, in healthcare to do it in a global presence and to do it with a diverse model. And also important to it is innovation, and I\'ll touch on that. Because I believe Abbott has a great track record here of shaping the Company. When I say shaping the Company, it\'s shaping the Company for the long-term, for the long-term success of our Company and for the value that we bring to our customers, to our patients and to our shareholders as well.
And 2016 was a significant year for that, for Abbott, to that point. I\'ll touch on the performance first for Abbott. Abbott had a great year of performance. We met all our financial objectives, whether that was sales, whether that was our earnings per share commitments, but also our return goals and also the focus that we have on cash flows. So, it was an outstanding year of execution.
But to your point, Matt, it also was another significant step in our shaping to leadership. If you take a look at our businesses, from nutrition to brand generics to diagnoses and ultimately to the medical device side, we needed to do something to establish leadership, particularly in the cardiovascular space. And we saw St. Jude as perfect opportunity to bring together two companies in a very complementary way, building a number one or number two position of leadership, and mark a large market that is fast growing and we thought it was the right timing. And we are very excited about the pipeline that the St. Jude had. And not just that St. Jude had, but I think I need to mention that Abbott, we\xe2\x80\x99re very excited about the pipeline that Abbott has.
When you look across our businesses, innovation has always been a part of our operating model it means different things to different businesses. And currently means something different to our brand and generics nutrition business versus what it might mean to us in terms of diagnostics and devices. But we have a high class product and then we do have a lot of innovation. And we\xe2\x80\x99re excited about what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do with that innovation over the coming year, and the timing was exactly right with St. Jude to do that.
And we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward now to move into execution mode after the close of St. Jude. But it goes back to, again as I mentioned, the imbalance, having leadership, and then performing at a level that is at or above our competitors around the world and that\xe2\x80\x99s what Abbott strives to do year-after-year.
Q - Matt Taylor
This is regarding St. Jude a little bit here. Maybe you can give us a sense for in the early days how the integration is going? And also talk a little bit about Abbott\'s experience here, clearly a lot of the companies over the years, and so to give a core capability there?
Brian Yoor
Matt, I think, as I think about Abbott and our experience over the years, sometimes your historical perspective informs how you do things in the future. And to Matt\'s point, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a great integration team and our Abbott transition team that has been operating for many years all the back for those who track Abbott back to an acquisition we made in the early 2000. And that team has stayed intact and has helped us with a very disciplined playbook of just how to go about integration, and also how to go about divestitures.
As we look at the St. Jude integration, we\xe2\x80\x99re very pleased with where we\'re at there. Our synergies are largely identified. We\'re well on track to achieve the commitments that we talked about, which was $500 million of synergies by year three. The team has operated well together, cultures are coming together quite well. But also I think as you look at the approach we\'ve taken, we\'ve found a great blend between the talent and leadership that St. Jude had in areas of expertise that otherwise Abbott doesn\'t and vice versa.
And I think sometimes when you take a step back and take a historical perspective of how to go about these things, we know, at Abbott that we\'re a great operator; we execute well; we\'ve an excellent track record of quality and compliance; and delivering the promises that we make to our shareholders. And so, as we shape the leadership around the combination of the Company, this comes into play in terms of which leaders assume which roles, and that\'s coming together very nicely.
It\'s also coming together nicely at the time where, as I mentioned St. Jude, had a very robust pipeline and still does of some outstanding technologies. Sometimes we tend to over-focus on the foundational elements, which I\'ll call the CRM business and as St. Jude\xe2\x80\x99s case where in Abbott\'s historical perspective the stand base, that\'s the foundation to compete; is to compete on the higher value added spaces; where the markets are growing and where innovation truly matters; whether that\'s in electrophysiology, which is a high growth market; whether that\'s in heart failure and structural heart, which are attractive markets; and also in St. Jude\'s case, neuromodulation.
And I want to just mention some of the innovations that they had and the timing, it was just perfect. They\'ve just launched in atrial fibrillation, a product by the name of EnSite Precision, which provides high depth mapping in a very efficient manner to find out how to best treat your atrial fibrillation through ablation, it\'s doing quite well. The catheter systems that they have around that\'s also makes it very competitive. In neuromodulation, I think sometimes that it gets overlooked, it\'s a smaller market. But they\'re quickly expanding that market and gaining share, because they have a full product line up now around pain management, as well as movement disorder such as Parkinson\'s.
And so if you look at St. Jude\'s portfolio, they have a spinal cord stimulation solution for pain; they\'ve a dorsal root ganglion solution for pain; and then also they have what\'s called deep brain stimulation for movement disorders, such as Parkinson. And I encourage people to watch these growth areas as this transaction progresses, because the whole idea here is to stabilize that foundation that we have together between the number one set company and Abbott; the number two CRM company in St. Jude; but yes, now we\'re going to compete on these higher growth areas that they have been we\'ll get to a point where that growth comes through.
Matt Taylor
While we\'re talking about the top line and some of your growth opportunities, it might be worth reviewing. And just to touch on some of the key new products and opportunities from the Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s side now. If you want to go over that in terms of what you\'re launching this year that could really make a difference?
Brian Yoor
Sure. And they\'re a little bit different by each space. But as I mentioned before, we\'ve never been more pleased about the level of innovation we have across Abbott. I just saw with diagnostics, in that we just launched, in Europe, a full suite of systems and solutions known as Alinity that spans all of the in-vitro diagnostics spaces that we\'re looking to compete in.
And so, we most recently received approval with our immuno assay systems, our clinical chemistry systems, our blood screening systems and our point of care hand held. We\'re looking to move forward as we move through the year on approvals for hematology system, as well as our molecular systems in Europe. And then after once Europe receives approval, typically about a one year lag from when you would start to see this full suite of in-vitro diagnostic solutions available to the United States.
It\'s important here though to understand what\xe2\x80\x99s encouraging to us, this a long build. Because if you think about the diagnostics business cycle; they are contractual in nature; a certain portion comes up for re-contracting each year, or there becomes a portion of the market they used to compete on. And so, when you\'re launching a system of this magnitude, you\'re not going to see the one-time, I call it, grand slam. You\'re going to see a slow evolution in build of the continued competitiveness that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already had in diagnostics.
And so that\'s very encouraging to us to have this unmatched innovation around the world for a business that was already delivering well above market growth rates in diagnostics. If I step forward to many you are familiar FreeStyle Libre. For those of you who aren\'t aware of FreeStyle Libre, it is an innovative patch that you wear behind the arm; and its pain free; it\'s scanning technology that allows you to monitor as frequently as you want your glucose levels.
And we have achieved upwards of over 250,000 users outside the United States. This product started as -- actually a consumer based production through web shops. And the gravitation to it was so strong that ultimately we had to build more capacity. And then also, we have an opportunity and are building up on that to balance the mix between what cash based sales and reimbursed sales in Europe, and we\'re starting to see that mix change and we\'re seeing outstanding double digit growth; it\'s one of its kind technology; we filed for approval in the United States in latter part of 2016; and so, we\'re moving through that process. But again, FreeStyle Libre, is one of its kind and it provided significant growth to our diabetes business.
If you look at our other businesses in terms of nutritional and branded generics, they\'re quite different, but not insignificant. I mean, you\'re always innovating your portfolio, it\'s going to come through dosing forms; through packaging; through flavors; through segmentation of the market. And if I start with nutrition, we have one of the broadest portfolios compete around the world. We have excellent manufacturing supply chain network. We\'ve built our presence organically where we need to be to compete for the longer term; and are well positioned, not just in the pediatric market but also in the adult market worldwide; adult sales represent 45% of our sales in our nutrition business; and have strong growth behind it outside the U.S. as well.
If I go to branded generics against similar, you think about renovation, you think about packaging changes. Our branded generics one of its kind in that we are the only multinational company competing solely in branded generics, and doing it in those market, those emerging markets where consumers reaching to pocket from a self pay, because they want the quality and the trust and the reputation of a company like Abbott. And so we build out our leadership positions in countries of India, in the Latin America region. We\'re leader in Russia where we need to be for leadership for where the growth markets are.
This business has really grown into the business we\xe2\x80\x99ve always envisioned it could be, but through shaping, I would say. And you look at its growth rates at high single digits or double digit sales growth. We\'re really excited about the value it brings to Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio as well. So, to Matt\'s point, a lot of innovation across a lot of the businesses it means different things to each business that\xe2\x80\x99s an important part of our operating model to bring value to all of our stakeholders.
Matt Taylor
Great. As we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about growth here, I want to turn to the audience, and let ask them a question and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk a little bit about your guidance for this year. So, this question is, do you view the midpoint of Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s 2017 guidance is conservative in the middle of the road or geographic? So, please see in your favor you answer, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk a little bit about your expectations for the year. So, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some middle of roads, so modestly conservative, some very conservative, a couple on geographic side, but view a little bit more conservative. So, I guess can you talk about your process in terms of developing guidance. Talk a little bit about what the goals are for the year and how you expect to achieve this?
Brian Yoor
I\xe2\x80\x99d say our guidance that we provide is balanced. As I look at the various risks and opportunities that exist across the portfolio, from a full year perspective, we\xe2\x80\x99ve set it at a very prudent level. I will tell you that we received investor feedback that sometimes when you have a low first quarter and too high of a fourth quarter that there might be some concerns, or they look at the optics and say is this achievable. I would like for nothing more than to get off to a fast start in Q1, and maybe in be a little bit that are ahead of our expectations, want we see how that plays out. Again, does that change the view for the full year, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\'s probably too early.
There is a lot of things out there; there\xe2\x80\x99s things you could control; and what\'s you\xe2\x80\x99re in control of and how you execute. But there is also things you can\xe2\x80\x99t control; such as the where the dollar moves; where the trade policies settle; where the tax comes up. But for those things that we can execute, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re properly balanced; nothing that I would tell you and you set a plan and you come up with your guidance, one thing is for certain, you will never get there exactly the way that you planned it. But that\xe2\x80\x99s part of Abbott\'s model to be nimble, to be able to adjust quickly. And so, as I look at the middle of the road, even though it skewed to the conservative side, the vast majority on the middle of the road. I agree with that that we\xe2\x80\x99re properly balanced for the full year. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see where the first quarter lands and how to think about that. And we\'ll go from there.
Matt Taylor
And maybe just what are some of your key factors that you\'re thinking about, whether its products or macro factors that potentially puts you up or down in the range as we move forward?
Brian Yoor
I think, there is a couple of things we\xe2\x80\x99re watching. Obviously, I mentioned innovation, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a great problem to have as many shots on goal as we have. But when you think about our major product introductions, we want to keep them on track, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s in our med device business, particularly here with St. Jude, as well as with our diagnostics business and the continued rollout of Alinity. One thing that\xe2\x80\x99s a little beyond our control that is a class effect or an industry effect, there is just when China and the nutrition market will, I\xe2\x80\x99d say, stabilize a bit. They\'re going through a bit of transition in terms of some new food safety regulations that they\xe2\x80\x99re enacting. And there is obviously been some big changes in the channel mix there.
One thing I can say for certain is we are very well positioned moving through that to compete here. Because we have the broad, I\xe2\x80\x99d say, manufacturing the supply chain network that will give us the most opportunity to continue to segment attractive market for the longer period of time in China. And as I mentioned too with our, China is only less than 2% of our sales nutrition, pediatric nutrition in China, while gets a lot of attention. It\xe2\x80\x99s a relatively small part of Abbott. But that said, it\'s an important part.
And then it\'s important part that we\xe2\x80\x99re well positioned to come out of strong and we will. But that\xe2\x80\x99s what I like about this diversified model at Abbott is that some things are always not going to be clicking on all cylinders at all times. But the diversity and breadth that we have, and our growth in emerging markets across all our businesses, which has been double-digits since Abbott separated from AbbVie; puts us in a great position to navigate these things and not make short term decisions that have repercussions down the road. We\'re going to make the right long term decisions.
What we can\'t control, and there\'s a lot of focus on that; we can\'t control currency; we\'ll watch that; early on I think some people would say that the rates we were at when we guided that they are a little bit better, acknowledged. But I will say that all of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s policies and stated intents around what we want to do from tax reform to trade policy point to a somewhat stronger dollar. So, I don\'t want to get ahead of ourselves on some of these things that we can\'t control Matt.
Matt Taylor
Then thinking about growth that you\'ve guided to mid single-digit operational growth this year. Can you talk about what do you think a sustainable growth rate is for the Company? And whether you could potentially see that accelerate over next couple of years?
Brian Yoor
I don\'t want underestimate what it means to sustainably grow to mid single-digit, which I classify as anywhere from 4% to 6%. In a global growth environment that spent sub 3%, that looks good. Let\xe2\x80\x99s watch and see if the global growth environment picks up over time before we start to talk about levels above that mid single-digit. Because Abbott has always strived and has, since the separation of AbbVie and even before that; been a double-digit underlying growth performer; and we have delivered strong underlying double-digit growth for our investors since the separation from AbbVie; currency is a bit of headwind against that.
And for that model, though, to be sustainable, Matt, it probably is somewhere around that mid single-digit top line growth coupled with some continued margin expansion, which gross margins has always been in our focus and will never go away. It will continue to be. We\'ve made great stride in some of our businesses to expand our margins. We\'ve made great strides to eliminate non-productive G&A, but I think there\'s a lot more opportunity there, particularly when you bring St. Jude into the mix and the synergies that we\'re looking at to have that type of model that\'s sustainable for that double-digit underlying growth. And that probably means growth anywhere from 5% to 6%.
When we plan for 2017, I think it\'s important to note that we didn\'t expect with our acquisition of St. Jude that our combined cardiovascular business would be growing 4% to 5% out of the gates. We\'re taking it one step at a time; we\'re going to stabilize the CRM business; we had a nice step in the right direction with the MRI-safe approval with St. Jude; already, we\'re starting to see some nice early trends with the low voltage implants from that action; and we\'re working towards the high voltage towards the end of the year approval; and we\'re going to continue to stabilize that. As we do that, we will start to see the combined business of cardiovascular neuromodulation gravitate more towards that mid single-digit that would be in line with how Abbott is growing.
Matt Taylor
Can we ask the audience question number three, I mean we skip two or go to three, just so give us an idea of where you should focus to drive better stock price performance. And this of course is -- the audience can make a choice between some things that are not really usually exclusive. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what they\'re saying and then we can talk about some of these other topics. So, revenue growth is number one, where we\'ve got some votes for EBIT, earnings and cash flow growth. So we talked a lot about revenue. So maybe we can talk a little bit more about some of these other below the line factors; one of the things that is going to help you drive the those goals is the $500 million in synergies from St. Jude, which you touched on. But, can you talk about that and in the context of Abbott being able to drive further margin expansion as a corporation beyond the synergies as well.
Brian Yoor
As mentioned, again, our target for the synergies with our acquisition of St. Jude was $590 million by 2020. We\'re well on track for that. The synergies will come in the form of, as you\'d expect, taking out redundant G&A expenses early on. That\'ll dominate the proportion of synergies in the early part. But also to bring our organizations together through our selling model, our enterprise selling approach that ultimately with the value of all of our products coming together that as we go, talk to our various constituents, it\'s going to put us into a better competitive position to have faster sales and sales synergy in the margin that comes with that over the longer term.
Matt referring to the fact too that we had a lot of great performance and margin expansion; we know how to do this; we\'ve been doing this in our diagnostics business. We\'ve taken the margins from our diagnostics business to what was at one-time 9% to close to 25%. There still room to go, there absolutely is. With this launch of these new systems that I\'m talking about with Alinity, while it won\'t happen overnight; they bring standardization overtime; they bring simplification; they bring lower cost to serve your customer.
But they also bring a value proposition. They bring a value proposition as a win-win for us to sell these, because our customers want not to say test or not just a piece of equipment, but the service and outcomes that comes with running a lab from the total cost of ownership. And so that provides opportunity for us to, maybe not expand margins at the same pace we have been but to steadily increase our margins there in diagnostics.
In nutrition, we\'ve been shaping around the globe of where we\'re present with our manufacturing, with our research and development to make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s tailored appropriately to the local markets we serve. And again, with that network we built through plants in China and India, ADR facility in the U.S. We have opportunity to continue to leverage that capacity to grow, both on adult and pediatric side and to improve our margins with what we\'ve done there around our network over time.
Branded generics has been a business, I would say, we\'ve been building our mode. We\'ve been making our contemplated plays of where we want to be the leaders around the world. As I mentioned, India, a very attractive market, we\'re in the number two position there. We made acquisition of a company by the name of CFR that build us out to a leader in Latin America, which is a very attractive branded generics market. And we also made an acquisition of a company by the name of Veropharm that put us into a leadership position in Russia.
The point being, as you\'re shaping and building that mode and building momentum and driving sales, it puts in a position now to say, let\'s leverage that scale number one but also let\'s look at those opportunities to rationalize our supply chain and find those improvement to expand margins, because we\'ve been in a bit of building mode and now I would suspect that we can continue to expand the operations for branded generics as well. Beyond that as I look at the G&A size of the equation, Abbott will always and everyday continue to focus on where we can eliminate non-productive G&A, even if it\'s not to, I\'ll say, achieve a higher EPS. It\xe2\x80\x99s more important for us to put back into the business given all the innovation we have and the opportunities that we have to drive growth for Abbott for the longer term.
Matt Taylor
And in just a couple of minutes we have left. Let\'s ask the audience another question about cash. So, this question asks about where Abbott should be most aggressive about reinvesting its cash flow? And we have many of choices here from acquisitions to internal investments and different things that you could do to return cash to shareholders, so\xe2\x80\xa6
Brian Yoor
That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of options.
Matt Taylor
It is. We have another on here then, and you talk about. So, we get the payment, which makes some sense and then pretty much across the board here. So, maybe talk a little bit about this time of a lot of moving parts. How you think about use of cash?
Brian Yoor
I think right now in the short-term, our big focus is debt repayment. I think the audience absolutely got it right. We come out of the gates this year, and doing the St. Jude acquisition with about $28 billion; so it\'s going to be in our best interest to pay down as much as we can as quickly as possible. As part of our deleveraging plans, we feel very comfortable about what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing. We\xe2\x80\x99ve enacted several cash flow initiatives that span, what you\'d call, the cash conversion cycle of days on hand, day sales outstanding and even days payable, where there\xe2\x80\x99s opportunities for us to unlock a little bit of otherwise the cash that\xe2\x80\x99s not productive to us today.
We\xe2\x80\x99ve sharpened what was already very disciplined capital expenditure process as well. And so, bringing down debt has many advantages. It brings back the flexibility that we want longer-term to do the capital allocation that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been accustom to; we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to growing the dividend; looking at the tuck-in acquisitions, as you mentioned. But the first priority is to pay down the debt and bring back our strategic flexibility, lower our interest expense and bring more of the enterprise value back to our shareholders.
Matt Taylor
Great. Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s all in time we have. And Brian thanks so much for your time, and thanks for your insight.
Brian Yoor
All right. Thank you, Matt.
