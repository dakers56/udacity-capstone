Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott\'s Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants\' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\'s expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Brian Yoor, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Thanks Miles. Before I review our financial performance, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to explain how we\xe2\x80\x99ll handle the transition from pre-separation Abbott results to post-separation Abbott results. In our remarks today regarding 2012, our results reflect all of the pre-separation businesses, including the proprietary pharmaceutical business. Our 2013 guidance and outlook will reflect only the new Abbott businesses.
Regarding 2013 comparisons to 2012 for New Abbott, we plan to provide investors with a post-separation base line of the quarterly income statement on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis with appropriate reconciliations prior to our first quarter earnings release in April. This will be for 2012. In order to provide this information, we must first complete in the coming weeks the so-called audited carve out of AbbVie results from Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s combined fourth quarter results.
Thanks Tom. This morning I\xe2\x80\x99ll provide a brief overview of the fourth quarter and full year 2012 performance for each of our major businesses that comprise the New Abbott. I\xe2\x80\x99ll also review our 2013 sales outlook by business. My comments will focus primarily on operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.
Question-and-Answer Session
(Operator instructions). Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JP Morgan.
Yeah. There\xe2\x80\x99s two basic things happened beyond amortization. There\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit of post-separation. I call it residual separation cost and there\xe2\x80\x99s some previously announced actions we took in areas of cost reduction, particularly in areas that impact manufacturing that do carryover into 2013. So that\xe2\x80\x99s the difference.
So the developed markets have been down in the last quarters mid-single digits and sort of two steps forward, one step back for a while here. So there\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of things that will evolve, that will drive EPD\xe2\x80\x99s growth. We believe very strongly in the growth in the various emerging markets. That will be driven by the launch of new products, of which there are many this year, new registration. So, the expansion of our product lines and the launch of new or improved products that have significant potential in these markets. So that will drive some of it. We\xe2\x80\x99re still rolling out geographic expansion. That will drive some growth and then we\xe2\x80\x99ve got good momentum in a number of these markets. So I think certainly on the emerging side, it\xe2\x80\x99s all going, I\xe2\x80\x99d say pretty much according to what we would expect.
Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
Vascular, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dismiss the potential second half benefits of ABSORB and MitraClip doing better in Europe, the expedition benefits we think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get in the market. Vascular we\xe2\x80\x99re expecting to see a nice pickup in momentum as we move from the first quarter on through the year. So there are a number of elements of it. Just to remind and I want to be sure from your question that it\xe2\x80\x99s clear to investors, our full year estimated growth over the baseline is mid to upper single digits growth. So I think that level of growth across the quarters with maybe a little bit better in the back and as we said, a little bit softer in the first quarter is the way to think about the year. So I think there are a lot of things going on that are going to accelerate the growth and we feel confident about that.
Miles White
Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
Yeah. David, I think Brian will just cover a couple of the business as you talked about where the momentum did pick up in the quarter and give you a little more color on that. Why don\'t you go ahead, Brian?
Hi David. Let me start with Nutritionals. As you saw in the quarter, we performed at double-digits. We were up double-digits year-over-year, and we had strong performance both in the U.S. as well as our international business. We\'ve been seeing strong performance out of the U.S. all year. In this quarter we saw particularly continued strong performance from our up-age toddler brands and we have PediaSure and Pedialyte there that have been performing double-digits; PediaSure, most notably consistently throughout the year. We also maintained as you know the share leadership there in the U.S. market as far as our infant formula market, where we have a commanding share lead. As we move into 2013, this may moderate a little bit, but we\'re up against the market in infant formula. That\xe2\x80\x99s relatively flat. However, we have a lot of momentum from our PediaSure and Pedialyte that will continue into next year that will help offset that.
Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.
Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
You\'re not going to have to wait for the fourth year to see it, Glenn, fourth quarter, rather.
We continue to have robust cash flow.
We know that. I think the large multinationals that are extremely well established have a better view of that than many. It\'s one of the reasons to be out of distributors and go direct. You can have a greater control over inventories and so forth. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that some competitors have indicated that they may have inventory challenges in the market and it\'s a hard \xe2\x80\x93 if you got too much inventory in the market you might think the market is slowing. I would tell you the underlying fundamentals of that market don\'t appear to us to be changing of slowing. So I think that any of us from time-to-time go through little ups and downs of the absorption of our products in that market. It\'s such a healthy market, such a good market that I think measuring it quarter-to-quarter isn\'t always that informative. 
You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to look at it over the course of the year and I think our competitors will probably acknowledge the same that it\'s a very healthy market, still robust and we\'re all still expanding into more cities. It\'s intensely competitive. It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously drawn a lot of competitive attention of the large four multinationals, which includes us, Mead, the Europeans do very well in that market and there\'s some local Chinese manufacturers in the value segments that are also growing and doing well. I don\'t have much to say about the market except that it\'s really robust, good and we\'re not experiencing a slowdown there, Glenn.
Brian Yoor
We have time for one more question. 
Operator
And our final question today is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
Larry Biegelsen \xe2\x80\x93 Wells Fargo
Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Tom, let me start with a financial question. The midpoint of the old guidance that you gave was about $2.03. The tax rate came down a little bit, gives you about $0.02. So that gets you about to $2.05 and the midpoint for today\'s guidance is $2.01. So am I doing the math right? What changed? And the baseline operating margin -- so I think the midpoint of the operating margin guidance for 2013 in the last call was about 18.5%. What is your best guess as that what that was for the new Abbott in 2012? And then I just have one follow-up.
Thomas Freyman
I\'d just like to clarify something. Obviously, this was the first time we\xe2\x80\x99ve provide guidance. On the third quarter call, as we moved into our discussions on the two new companies, we felt it was appropriate to provide some meaningful profile perspectives on both companies, which we did on that call and certainly -- and I think the key message there was from a New Abbott perspective was that given the topline growth and our ability to grow the bottom line and expand margins that we saw this as a double digit grower. So this was the first time we provided guidance. Now, if you look at that profile information, a lot has changed in the world since October, but not a lot has changed in terms of our forecast. We\'re still very close to that profile that we provided. Tax is a little bit better because of the R&D tax credit which obviously we didn\'t know about back in October and we\'ve gone through a budgeting process. 
We\'ve looked at final exchange rates, which in a number of countries have moved significantly since October and it\xe2\x80\x99s just a function of completing our budget process, which is why we didn\'t provide guidance in October because we knew we needed to go through that process before we could provide you a meaningful guidance number. So I think what we\'re providing today is very, very consistent with what we\'ve talked about in October and anything that \xe2\x80\x93 $0.01 or $0.02 up or down is really a function of just the process we\'ve been going through. So I think that hopefully answers your question there, Larry.
Larry Biegelsen \xe2\x80\x93 Wells Fargo
Tom, and the R&D tax credit for 2012, did you pushed that into 2013? And then I just wanted to ask, on the Established Pharma, the potential impact to the new drug pricing list in India, can you talk a little bit about that? We\'ve gotten some questions on it. I think you guys have roughly $800 million to $1 billion of exposure in India, and I\'ll drop. Thank you.
Thomas Freyman
Yeah. So the 2012 R&D tax credit, which as most investors know who have been following the story, very odd for all companies, the way this has to be handled. Since Congress didn\'t approve the law until after the 31st of December, the accounting impact of getting the 2012 credit actually becomes a 2013 accounting event. That is not reflected in our ongoing guidance. We\'re planning to call that out as a specified good news item, if you will, in our quarterly reporting in 2013 and that is not reflected. What is included in the guidance is the regular 2013 R&D credit, which is now law, which we can count on as we move through the year. With regard to your question on India, obviously there has been a fair amount of discussion with various ministries on the pricing environment in India. 
As one might expect, this has gone through a quite a range of discussion. The most recent feedback on this was more of a market-based model, which is much more consistent with the way we view the appropriate approach towards balancing innovation and customer needs within the market. And if you look at the result of that conclusion, it\'s very consistent with our planning assumptions for 2013 for the established pharmaceutical division. So, at this point in time we feel good about our assumptions. I know there are additional discussions going on and there is not a final approach towards this, but all information we have at this point is that our assumptions are solid for 2013.
