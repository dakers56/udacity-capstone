In the podium over, long-time attendee of these events. We\'re grateful for that. Alaska Air Group, Brandon Pedersen, it\'s current CFO of Alaska and Horizon made it out here just in the nick of time. Thank you very much for that. Let\'s keep on schedule and turn things over to you. Thank you so much.
Brandon S. Pedersen
Thanks, Jamie, and good afternoon, everybody. Two items of business before we dive into the presentation. One, I\'d like to introduce my colleague, Chris Berry. Chris is the Managing Director of Investor Relations. He can help with questions. The other is to draw your attention to the forward-looking statement. This presentation will have forward-looking statement disclaimer -- this presentation will have forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ, and I encourage you to read our 10-K for a more complete description of the risks.
So turning on. Overview, quick, of Alaska Air Group. And then what I\'m going to do is I\'m going to change up the presentation from what I would normally do. We were on the road meeting with investors last week, and what I tried to capture were the top 10 questions that we heard. And as you might imagine, they were pretty much the same as the top 10 questions that we\'ve heard upstairs through our one-on-one meetings today. So I thought it would be appropriate to reiterate those to you all and then also put them on the official record.
But really quick, recapping Alaska Air Group. First, we\'re the parent company of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air. Alaska is the 737 carrier. We currently have 125 airplanes. Horizon Air is our regional subsidiary. It actually does business now as Alaska airplanes are branded that way, a fleet of 48 Q400 turbo props with 76 seats. So both carriers are using a model that has worked well in this industry, both domestically and internationally, which is a single-fleet type.
We have about $4.7 billion in annual operating revenues, which puts us at about 3% to 4% of the U.S. domestic industry.  We actually like our size a lot. We think it\'s an advantage. We\'ve been able to post 9 consecutive years of profitability, including 2012, and I\'ll tell you a little bit more about that. And in fact, we\'ve been profitable for 15 consecutive quarters now. We have award-winning service. We\'ve won the J.D. Power award for highest in customer satisfaction for traditional network carriers, now 5 years in a row. And we have excellent operational performance. We think being an on-time airline is important to our customers. We think it\'s an -- also a low-cost way of doing business. We were just recently awarded the #1 on-time award by FlightStats, an organization that tracks these things for 2012. And we generally think we have very good labor relations, and I\'m happy to cover that as well. And in fact, I\'ll get to that in one of the questions.
So question number one that we\'ve received. How\'s business?
I think business is generally pretty good. If we look back and recap quickly the year 2012, we had an outstanding year. We were able to deliver pretax results of $552 million. We had a net profit of $339 million. We grew our bottom line earnings by 18%, and we grew earnings per share by 21%. That\'s both the 18% earnings growth as well as a reduction in the number of shares through our repurchase program that has been ongoing. If you look at our return on invested capital, this is something that our company talks about a lot. We finished the year with a 13% return on invested capital. That marks the third consecutive year in a row that we\'ve exceeded our 10% goal.
We\'ve been talking about the 10% goal now for almost a decade, and you can see how we have trended, but it was really 2010 that we hit the mark, \'11 we improved, and in 2012, as I said, we hit the 13% mark. It is notable to say that these are after-tax results. We look at ROIC as an after-tax measure, and we report it this way.
On a margin basis, we\'re consistently, or have been consistently among the best in the business. You can see our pretax margin was 11.9%, third behind only Allegiant and Spirit last year.  Again, we believe that a pretax margin percentage is a better metric than an operating margin percentage, because we think the financing cost that go down in the other are an important consideration for airlines. So again, pretax margin, 11.9%. You can see how that stacks up with the others in the business.
Business today, so you might say, "Well, how\'s business now?" And I would say business is generally, pretty darn good. We characterize the business environment as stable in our fourth quarter earnings call, and I think that, that\'s a fair characterization still. We don\'t see any impact from the payroll tax holiday expiring. Someone had asked about that, and in fact, I wondered about that myself. But we haven\'t seen any material or any significant or even noticeable impact from that. Corporate travel seems to be hanging in there just fine. We don\'t hear anything from our corporate customers that suggest that bookings are easing at all.
If we look at our January results, our January unit revenues were up on a consolidated basis, about 2%. That was on top of the 11% increase in capacity that we reported in January.  So we were pretty darn pleased with our result in January. In February, we just released our traffic results. Earlier this morning, our ASMs or capacity was up just under 5% on a consolidated basis. Our traffic was up 6%. So once again, we reported a 1.1% -- 1.1 point, excuse me, increase in load factor. Our advanced bookings, this is consistent with our last disclosure. Our March advances are about flat, and our April advances are down 1 point or so at this point.
Question 2. What does competitive capacity look like in your system? We have a chart that we\'ve been using in our investor deck just recently. There\'s a lot of detail, I won\'t walk through it, but I will draw your attention to the numbers on the bottom.  In Q1, we think competitive capacity in our market is up about 2% year-over-year. And in Q2, we think competitive capacity is up about 3% year-over-year.
There\'s a couple of notable regions that I\'d like to draw your attention to.  And this is a chart that\'s presented by region, the way we look at it internally in our business. Alaska, long haul, has seen a significant increase in competitive capacity. Now it\'s important to point out that these are relative -- on relatively low basis. And so the percentage increases looks significant, but we have seen a lot of seasonal increases by the larger network carriers from their hubs, up into Anchorage. And then we have seen some additional increases beyond that. An example might be JetBlue going from Seattle to Anchorage and Delta announcing seasonal service from Seattle to Anchorage on, again, a seasonal basis, those are redeye flights. The other is down there in transcon. There is some additional transcon capacity, although not much of that is out of Seattle.
Question 3. What\'s going on in Hawaii? And Hawaii is an interesting story for us. Many investors in this room probably know the story of how we grew in Hawaii. In 2007, we didn\'t have any flights to Hawaii. At the same time, we were launching our service to Hawaii, ATA and Aloha went out of business. And it created a very significant market opportunity for us, and we took advantage of it. We went from basically no flights a day in 2007 to now we offer 26 daily non-stops off the West Coast to Hawaii. Hawaii as a region, makes up about 20% of our ASMs but, because of the long-haul nature of the flying, it\'s really about 11% or 10% of our daily departures.
I think there\'s a little bit of a misunderstanding out there about what Hawaii has meant for us. Hawaii has been fantastic for us, don\'t get me wrong. But the questions that we get from investors are -- seem to be suggesting that this Hawaii thing was the only growth opportunity that this company has, and that, that is largely exhausted. I think that, that\'s an error to think that. If you look at what we\'ve done since 2001, we have grown the network significantly on a Hawaii -- from Hawaii -- or into Hawaii but also into many transcon markets and midcon markets. And I think there\'s a lot of growth left for this company out of the Pacific Northwest, out of California, perhaps even a little bit out of Anchorage, to places other than Hawaii.
If you look at the growth of Hawaii specifically, this chart basically illustrates what I was talking about, how our growth in Hawaii has been very significant over the last 5 years. But that growth is moderating a lot.  If you look at 2013, we expect capacity to Hawaii to be up in the aggregate, about 5%. But, really, if you peel back the onion one more layer, it\'s more like 10% in the first half of the year and about flat in the second half of the year.
In the gray box, there\'s a couple of notable things as well. We\'ve been very open about our -- I don\'t want to say disappointment. We\'ve been very open about how the unit revenue performance in certain of our Hawaii markets hasn\'t met our standards. And so what we\'ve done is we\'ve been making seasonal adjustments to make sure that the unit revenues in those markets improve.
Most of those adjustments will come in the Bay Area to the outer islands, and then as we move into the fall, there will be other adjustments that you\'ll be able to see in the schedule. So the word here is that because we\'re disappointed in the unit revenue performance that didn\'t meet our own expectations, we\'re actually taking action, which is, I think, consistent with the company\'s broader strategy of really trying to get capacity right, so that it meets the demand in a particular geography.
There\'s another here -- another story here about Hawaii, just really quickly. And that is looking at this drop because of the exit of ATA and Aloha, and where capacity was, where it fell to, and where it is now. If you look at the chart, in 2007, there were roughly 13,700 daily seats off of the West Coast to Hawaii. By mid-2008, because of the bankruptcy of those 2 carriers, that had dropped to 11,400. But because of the capacity that we\'ve put into that market, as well as the capacity added by others, that vacancy or that void has largely been filled.
Okay, question 4. How will the AMR-LCC merger impact you? I don\'t know. I think at the end of the day, it\'s pretty immature for us to speculate on what it might mean for us. We have 2 big partners in the U.S., American and Delta, and both have -- we have great relationships with both of those carriers. We haven\'t had any commercial discussions with the folks at U.S. Air at all. I think it\'s a long way down the road for us -- we talking about what it might mean for us. I know that we provide an important part of the Delta Network and the American network, and we don\'t have any reason to believe that, that won\'t continue.
All right, question 5. You want to grow 4% to 8% annually. Are you committed to that, or do you have flexibility?  I think the keyword on that is flexibility. Our strategic plan for the next 5 years is to grow capacity by 4% to 8% on an ASM basis, profits permitting. And that\'s really an important addition to the phrase, profits permitting. Because we\'re not -- we\'re first committed to delivering appropriate shareholder returns, then we\'re committed to growing 4% to 8%. We\'ve guided to about 8% capacity growth this year. About half of that comes from stage link increases and the gauge of the airplanes that we\'re flying and the other half comes from an increase in the number of departures.  So if you size adjust our 4% to 8% growth to our airline, it\'s not actually a very big number. And it\'s a number that we\'re very comfortable with.
So let\'s pick 6% just as a placeholder, as an example. If we grow at 6%, then we will have continued up-gauging as we buy larger aircraft, the 900 ER, and so that will probably be one of the 6. Just simply, that comes from up-gauging. So maybe you talk about it as being 5% on a departure basis. Well, for us, a rule of thumb that we use internally is 1% growth is about one airplane, is about one transcon, or Hawaii flight. And so the question really is do we think -- are there -- do we think there are profitable opportunities for us to deploy 5 or 6 airplanes per year? Yes, we do. And that doesn\'t feel big -- like a big number to us. Although as I said, flexibility is the key, and we\'re first committed to delivering appropriate returns than we\'re committed to growing.
On this chart, it shows our fleet plan. As you can see, in 2007, we had an addition of 7 airplanes to the fleet. In 2008 -- or excuse me, 2012, 2013. In 2013, we expect to take 9 airplanes into the fleet, but we expect to have 6 go back on leased returns for a net increase of 3. So compare that growth of 3 units which is really the draw on investment capital to the disclosed ASM growth of 8%. And you can kind of get a sense of what I\'m talking about. And in 2014, we\'re taking delivery of 10 airplanes. We plan to have 13 go back. Although I would say that\'s a bit fluid right now, because that includes 5 of our specialty airplanes, the 737-400 Combi, which we used up in the state of Alaska. So it\'s -- as I said, 2014 is a bit fluid at this time.
The other thing that gives us a great deal of flexibility is that we own most of our fleet, about 75% in fact.  And so to the extent that we have an airplane come in, and we find ourselves long on airplanes, we\'ll just sell something. The economics of bringing in a 737-900ER and getting rid of a 737-700 are compelling. We\'ll deal with that all day long. I have a saying internally, I would much rather be looking for airplanes, than at airplanes. So we\'ll be flexible and opportunistic in how we grow.
Okay. So if we grow, -- investors often ask us about CapEx. Here\'s a chart that shows what our CapEx would be. You can see, looking back toward 2007, we were in the midst of a big refleeting, as we got rid of the MD-80s. CapEx came down in 2008, 2009, \'10, started to creep up in \'11. 2012, last year, we had capital spending of $518 million, and you can see where we\'ve disclosed 2013, \'14 and \'15 will be based on what is firm, based on what our options are for 737 aircraft, and based on what our options are for Q400 aircraft, again, to be operated by our regional subsidiary Horizon.
Question 6. Where will you grow and will those markets have lower margins than the system average? Again, I sort of touched on this. We think there\'s a heck of a lot of growth still to be had using the same template that we have used over the last decade or so. We\'ve -- Hawaii was, obviously, a big part of it, as you know, but we\'ve also been able to expand to lots of places east, as shown on this chart right here. These is all the places, all the new routes that we\'ve had since 2001. So we think there are places yet to go out of Seattle. We think there are frequency opportunities out of Seattle. We think there are some of that to do out of Portland. We think there\'s a little bit of that to do out of, perhaps, Alaska. And we do think that there are opportunities for us to do that out of California as well.
California right now is about 20% of our business. We have a customer base down there that knows us, principally, as an airline that they like to fly when they go up north to Seattle or Portland or Alaska. They\'re now getting used to our service to Hawaii. They like the fact that we offer, statistically, the lowest fares to Hawaii of any carrier. And so it\'s a matter of building that brand recognition, building the loyalty to the Alaska product, so we can grow into east --  destinations east and the midcon and transcon markets as well.  So as we look out 5 years or so, we think there are profitable opportunities for us to grow too.
The second half of that question was, will the new markets have margins that are lower than the system average. And I would say, the answer to that is probably so. And the reason is, is that like in any business that does R&D activities, R&D, or developmental markets, as we call them, will naturally have margins that are lower than the system average. But the idea is to have those markets develop while we have other markets coming into maturity, and so we don\'t dilute it as much as that one new market would.
The other thing is, just logically I would say, that  unless you assume that we saved the best for last, that newer markets will have lower margins. But the key for us is to say, can we deploy these airplanes in a way that\'s consistent with our commitment of generating returns in excess of our cost of capital. And for us, the goal is 10%  ROIC, because our weighted average cost of capital is 7% to 8%. And so, by doing so, we create value. But again, the whole mindset here is not to grow just for growth\'s sake, it\'s to grow into developmental markets, so we can continue to refresh the network. And so as we look down the path 5 years or so, we think there\'s plenty of opportunities to do that.
All right, question 7. Where are you with labor negotiations? The first thing I\'d say is that we have really good relations with our employees. And our employees are largely the reason for our success.  They bring a customer experience that is award-winning, as I told you. But more than that, they develop one-on-one relationship with our customers that I think are unique in the airline industry or among a few only.
We are, right now, in negotiations with our pilots. Our pilot agreement is amendable on April 1 of this year. We\'re feeling good about the progress that we\'re making with our pilots. Our flight attendants have been open for about a year or so, and then we\'ve got a couple of groups on the Horizon side that are open as well.
It\'s might be useful to share our philosophy. Our philosophy is we that we want to pay our people well. And when I say well, it\'s when we compare them to other carriers in the industry, we want our people to feel like they\'re very well paid. But as a carrier that\'s relatively small in this business, we want to be able to fund that with really high productivity. And I think we\'ve made really good progress. And the other thing we want to do is we want to share generously with our employees when things are good, as we have over the last couple of years.
You might have caught a press release a couple of weeks ago, or maybe it was even last week, I\'m losing track of time, where it was essentially bonus day at Alaska Air Group. And every single frontline employee -- every single employee at Alaska got a bonus that was at least 8% of pay or about one month\'s pay. So for us to be able to share $88 million with our employees through variable pay because the company exceeded its goals, is something that we\'re really, really proud of.
Why do you pay more for fuel than anybody else? Well, I think in a word, it\'s geography. And here, we put together a little reconciliation. There\'s a certain other carrier out there that guided Q4 at $3 -- or had Q4 fuel of $3.19 a gallon. And people say, "Oh, my God, Alaska is paying $3.43 a gallon. You guys must be nuts, and not know how to buy." But there\'s a pretty logical explanation for it. First, the LA jet premium differential is about $0.09 historically -- or was in the fourth quarter. It simply costs more for jet fuel on the West Coast. That\'s the geography thing that I was talking about.
There\'s this next line called geographic mix and other. And some of that is just due to the fact that we buy fuel in places that are kind of a hard to get to, up in the state of Alaska for example. That and other timing differences account for what we believe to be about $0.05, which gets us up to $3.33. And then our hedges represent about -- or represented in the fourth quarter, about $0.10 per gallon.
We believe our hedging program is sound. We like what we\'re doing, we\'ve been doing it for about 10 years. Are there other ways to think about hedging? Absolutely. But we hear from many of our large shareholders that our program, where we use hedges as caps on the price of oil provides meaningful comfort to them and their investment.
Number 9. Should you be buying back more stock and would you consider a dividend?  I think some historical perspective is good here too. Since 2007, we have been active in share buyback programs, and in fact, from the period 2007 through 2010, we\'ve repurchased more than $320 million of our stock. In the fall of 2012, we announced a share repurchase authorization that was $250 million and about 10% of the market cap at the time that we did it. It was, and I think it is, still, the biggest share repurchase authorization that\'s going in the airline industry. Should we do more? You know, that\'s up for debate. I think one of the things, as you get to know Alaska, is you\'ll find that we\'re a pretty conservative group, and we like to be really thoughtful and deliberate in how we do things and we have a longer-term perspective.
It was just 6 months ago that we were being congratulated on the size of our repurchase program, and now folks are saying, "Boy, you should be doing it much quicker than that," or, "Geez, that\'s a dumb idea. Maybe you should be doing a dividend." Again, we want to be more thoughtful and deliberate about how we do things. We\'re really happy with the share repurchase program that we\'ve got. As you can see on the chart here -- the bars from 2007 to 2012 are the $320 million I talked about. But for 2013 and 2014, we still have about $240 million left under the authorization that we plan to use relatively ratably. The commitment is to be done with this by the end of 2014.
That\'s not guidance. That\'s just how it might look. We would certainly take advantage of weakness if it presented -- share price weakness if it presented itself, to move things around. But it just really illustrates how much we\'re going to be repurchasing over the next couple of years.
The second part is, would we ever consider a dividend? Yes, we would someday consider a dividend. It\'s something that we talk with our board about periodically. We get the pros and cons of a dividend. Our shareholders tell us that they like the fact that a repurchase, particularly, when we believe we\'re undervalued makes economic sense. Our shareholders tell us that they like the fact that we don\'t create a tax event. But we also understand that there\'s pros to a dividend too. This is -- I have no announcement imminently, but I just want investors to know that we are talking about this. We do think about the pros and cons, and it\'s not something we would rule out, but it\'s not something that\'s imminent, that\'s for sure.
And finally, the question comes, why did you traded the discount to the group? And the answer to that question is, I don\'t know. I think all of you in the audience probably are better versed than that than I am. We\'re just trying to run a business and do it well. But the question has been, it has been a pervasive question for the last few years. If you look at the 2 primary metrics in our industry, P/E and E/V EBITDAR, we are second to last in the industry when it comes to the E/V EBITDAR metric. This was created last week. So this is probably a little bit out of date. We had a good couple of days. But we were trading on a 4.3 multiple on the E/V EBITDAR measure, and then on the P/E metric, it\'s more like, I think it\'s about 9 right now, which we have had share price -- the share price has been done well, but I think it\'s been more multiple expansion for the group as opposed to a change in Alaska\'s relative position in the industry.
So let me conclude. The investment case for Alaska.  To recap, one, I think we\'re one of the only airlines to achieve returns in excess of the cost of capital, all right? As I said, our weighted average cost of capital is 7% to 8%. Our ROIC last year was 13%. We\'re profitable, and we\'re growing, and we have margins that exceed most others in the U.S. industry. We have strong cash flows. We didn\'t talk about cash flows at all, but last year, we generated operating cash flow of about $750 million and significant free cash flow, even after we fund all of our CapEx.
We have an excellent and greatly improved balance sheet. We\'ve loved this idea of balanced capital allocation, repurchasing stock, funding pensions, prepaying debt and paying cash for airplanes, and because of that, we\'ve been able to do some great things to the balance sheet.  We have low leverage. Our debt to cap has declined from a high of 81% to now at 54% debt to cap at the end of the year. And as I said, we\'ve been putting money into the pensions, more than $500 million, even when there\'s no obligation to do so over the past 4 or 5 years, and so our pensions are well funded and about an 82% on a PBO basis.
And finally, we\'re very focused on shareholder returns. This goes all the way back to what our current Chairman and x-CEO, Bill Ayer, described in what we called at the time The 2010 Plan, which is not only to be a great airline but to be a great business, focused on creating a good product that customers like, having -- providing a place to work for employees that they genuinely enjoy and they have security retirements but not leaving shareholders out of the equation. And we have this goal of a 10% ROIC over the business cycle. And I think we\'re headed in the right direction.
So with that, I\'ll take your questions.
Unknown Analyst
Would you be able to put up the list of popular questions, your top 10 list?
Brandon S. Pedersen
Sure. There\'s not one slide that has them all, but yes.
Unknown Analyst
No, we can read it. I was just curious. Do you think that question #7 and question #9 or rather the phenomenon of those questions are in conflict with one another? I mean, as you sit down with labor, is the ask by labor inflated by the fact that you are as profitable as you are, you are buying back stock, you\'re open to the concept of returning cash not to employees but to shareholders?
Brandon S. Pedersen
Yes. It\'s a darn good question, and one that we\'ve spent a lot of time thinking about, and one that we\'ve invested quite a bit of effort into getting our head around and trying to actually solve it. This industry, this business, doesn\'t work if there\'s this constant put and take of companies becoming profitable and then the collecting -- through the collective bargaining process, that all goes to labor. If you ask, nearly -- well, hopefully, you wouldn\'t prove me wrong, but if you ask any Alaska Airlines employee, what the profit goal of the company is, I bet you they would tell you $0.10 without hesitating. And that is a euphemism that we use to describe a 10% pretax margin, which loosely translates to a 10% return on invested capital.  We just recently finished a program that we called Flight Path, where we had all 10,000 Alaska employees, and we\'re almost done finishing the 3,000 Horizon employees, where we brought them in for a full day into a nice place in groups of 150 at a time. So do the math, that\'s a lot of seminars.  And the goal was to really teach them about the company, teach them about the financial engine and help them understand where we\'re going in terms of the strategic plan and also, the kinds of profits that we need to generate to grow.  And in fact, teaching them that you need profit to grow.  And the discussion evolves through the day, so that they get to a point where they hear that it\'s a 10% pretax margin, a 10% ROIC, but in their words, a $0.10 on the dollar. So for every revenue, we keep $0.10 on the dollar before we pay our taxes as the goal of the company. And if we can achieve that goal, we will be able to grow and do all the good things that come with growth.  Now if we\'re not able to achieve a $0.10 goal or a 10% pretax margin, then we won\'t be able to grow.  And so helping them understand that one is necessary for the other, I think -- hopefully, will pay dividends for us.

[Question Inaudible]
Brandon S. Pedersen
I mean the dividend in a different way.
Yes, question in the back there?
Unknown Analyst
[Question Inaudible]
Chart for the deliveries.
Brandon S. Pedersen
Yes, let me go back to that.
Unknown Analyst
[indiscernible] how much of that is growth versus retirements?
Brandon S. Pedersen
Any options for Q400 growth for the foreseeable...
Unknown Analyst
I don\'t think if anybody heard the question...
Brandon S. Pedersen
Yes, I can repeat the question. Question was of the CapEx related to Q400s, how much of that is related to replacement versus how much of that is growth? All of the Q400 spending that you see on the chart right here would be related to Q400 growth. The fleet right now is 48. We have a big tranche of Q400 scheduled for lease return out in 2018, but really no scheduled returns between now and 2018.  So the CapEx would be for growth. Again, we are not necessarily committed to this until we see that we have profitable opportunities to deploy those airplanes.
Unknown Analyst
Okay. And so I guess, and related to that, the growth opportunity that you talked about overall, how much of that is -- how does Horizon or, I guess...
Brandon S. Pedersen
Sure, the regional business?
Unknown Analyst
Fit into that?
Brandon S. Pedersen
I think there\'s a lot of synergy between the growth of the mainline business and the growth of the Horizon business. I think the primary growth engine of the company is the mainline business. But there are places that we would use the Q400 both to provide additional feed into places like Seattle. So as the airline grows volume, we\'ll need more feed. And I think there\'s a place for Q400s to do that. And then there\'s an opportunity to use Q400s to other places where we have jets now, where jets might not be the right airplane. One of the things that we\'ve done really well since 2009 is mix and match Q400s and 737s so that we have the right airplane and the right market at the right time of day. And there are other places in the network where we can use Q400s more strategically, and we\'re looking at those places right now, perhaps up even in the State of Alaska, where Q400s have not yet flown. Are you from Bombardier? Okay.
Any other questions? Yes?
Unknown Analyst
Just getting back to labor and the pilots in particular. If you accept that Delta and United are the market right now, and I can certainly look at 12-year cap and hourly rates and that sort of stuff, but it\'s more challenging for analysts to drop work rule nuances and what have you into the model. But if Delta and United represent the market, what sort of an impact to the P&L annually does that imply for Alaska?
Brandon S. Pedersen
Yes, it\'s hard to quantify that because you end up basing it based on hourly rates. As you say, there\'s a lot of nuance with productivity and work rules and benefit plans and how you look at profit sharing. I think it is fair to say that we acknowledge that the market for pilot wages has moved in the last 6 months to a year because of some of the deals that have been done by the other carriers. We fully acknowledge that, in fact. And I think it\'s fair to say that our pilots will get a raise when we finally get to a deal.  I do think it\'s also appropriate to note that the percentage won\'t nearly be as much as you\'ve seen at some of the other carriers, because our pilots were in better shape that are going into this. And so the delta -- no pun intended, the delta is bigger -- or was bigger with the other carriers than it is with our pilots. The other thing we\'re trying to do is we\'re trying to -- as I said, there\'s opportunities for productivity. That\'s probably more the case with the flight attendants. It\'s how you move out of legacy-style benefits like DB plans. We\'re not suggesting that we need to close the DB plan right now. But we would like a path to eventually closing the DB plan. It\'s looking at retirement or medical contributions. And then it\'s also how do you look at our Performance-Based Pay plan where a pilot has a target bonus equal to 5% of pay versus a more traditional profit-sharing plan, where it\'s just some percentage of dollar one of profit, so there\'s no target, specifically, whereas as I said, in our program, there\'s a target percentage of pay. So how do you think about that in the context of your hourly rate, is it in or is it out. So it\'s very multidimensional. But I do think it\'s fair to say that we would acknowledge that the scale has moved.
