Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Allstate Corporation Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Robert Block, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Robert Block
Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for Allstate\xe2\x80\x99s third quarter earnings conference call. This morning, Tom Wilson, Don Civgin and I will give some commentary on our results. Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll open it up for your questions. Joining us for the Q&A are Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; Joe Lacher, President of Allstate Protection; Sam Pilch, Controller; and Matt Winter, President of Allstate Financial.
During the Q&A session, we ask you that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up so that we can hear from as many of you as time allows. As is our practice, yesterday, we provided our earnings press release, investor supplement, and filed our 10-Q for the third quarter of 2010. We also posted a presentation that we will be using on today\xe2\x80\x99s call. All of these documents can be found on our website.
As noted on Slide 1 of the presentation, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate\xe2\x80\x99s operations and actual results may differ materially. So refer to our Form 10-K for 2009, Form 10-Q for the third quarter, and our most recent press release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion may contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available shortly following the completion of the call. Christine Ieuter and I are always available to answer any additional questions you may have after this call ends.
Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Tom Wilson for his perspective on the quarter.
Thomas Wilson
Well, Good morning. Thank you for investing your time to hear about Allstate and the progress we\xe2\x80\x99re making to deliver value for shareholders. I am going to start with a quick overview of results for the quarter. Then Bob will go through each business units, and Don will cover our investment performance, balance sheet and capital positions. Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll open it up for your questions.
In the third quarter we were again successful in executing strategy that creates shareholder value despite a weak economy. So, while we begin, go to Slide 2. In total, we generated $367 million in net income on $7.9 billion of revenue. There was an increase in net income of $146 million. That was primarily due to less realized capital losses this quarter than in Q3 2009.
Operating income was $452 million or $0.83 per share, which was $86 million below the same quarter last year. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a result of lower operating income from Allstate Protection, our property-liability segment. Property-liability had an underlying combined ratio of $89.2 million for the quarter, bringing the full year or the nine months up to $88.8 million. That\xe2\x80\x99s squarely in the middle of our annual outlook of $88 million to $90 million that we provided in February.
We did experience an increase in (inaudible) third quarter but remain comfortable with loss trends. Growing Allstate Protection is critical to our success. While we are able to largely maintain revenues from prior year levels, we need to generate more unit growth.
The Standard Auto policies in force declined from $17.8 million last year to $17.5 million this year, as strong growth in new business in most of the country was offset by declines in several large states where we have taken action to improve profitability. These actions also had a negative impact on improving customer loyalty in the quarter. Since our major competitors also had declines in customer loyalty this quarter, it was really a missed opportunity for us to improve our relative position.
Efforts to improve returns in homeowners and Encompass independent agency business also had a negative impact on growth. New business growth was a result of several things, it was up 2.4%; increased advertising a successful edition of the Mayhem campaign to our marketing programs and targeted pricing actions to improve our auto competitive position.
Homeowners\xe2\x80\x99 profitability remains a concern although progress is being made as our rate actions work into the numbers. Catastrophe losses this quarter were low relative to other third quarters, but we had no major hurricane losses. The amount of non-model cat losses remained at high levels. We continue to see price and tight underwriting standards while we deployed better risk management tools in order to generate acceptable returns.
Allstate Financial continues to generate strategical reposition its business while raising returns. Operating income of $108 million was below the last two quarters due to several positive one-time items earlier in the year. Premium deposit volume was down as expected as we shift from spread-based businesses to mortality-morbidity products. Allstate Financial did grow both the worksite and Allstate agency businesses where premiums and deposits on underwritten products were up 33% and 2% respectively compared to Q3 2009. Allstate Financial also completed its focus to win cost reduction efforts.
Investments had another great quarter from total return perspective as the portfolio continues to generate substantial [cache] and proven value. The net unrealized gain in the portfolio rose to $2.7 billion. This gain reflects lower interest rate and improved valuations on structured securities. While lower interest rates do translate into higher valuations, it puts pressure on operating income. We\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to reduce our municipal bond and real estate holdings, which also puts downward pressure on operating income. Don will cover the impact to that in a few minutes.
The net result of this operating performance was to raise book value per share to $35.48, that\xe2\x80\x99s up 6.7% over the last three months, and is almost 10% higher than the year-ago. And now I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Bob go through the results in greater detail.
Robert Block
Turning to Slide 3, here are the property-liability premium and underwriting income results. In the third quarter, we produced a net premium written of almost $6.8 billion, which was a slight decline from Q3 2009. Total net written premium for the Allstate brand increased slightly but was more than offset by a decline in our Encompass brand. Within the Allstate brand, our Standard Auto net written premium fell by 0.5% after small increases in the first two quarters of the year. Increases in new issued applications of 2.5% and average premium of 1.4%, both compared to prior year\xe2\x80\x99s quarter were more than offset by a decline in retention resulting in the premium shortfall. Total units also fell 0.3% sequentially and 1.7% from third quarter 2009.
Homeowner net written premium increased quarter-over-quarter by 2.4%. Increases in average premium driven by approved rate increases and retention were more than enough to offset the 4% decline in total units.
The recorded combined ratio for the third quarter was 95.9%, 1.2 points higher than the third quarter 2009. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the effects of catastrophe losses and prior-year reserve re-estimates was 89.2, right in the middle of our annual outlook range we provided at the start of the year.
Catastrophe losses for the quarter were $386 million or a recorded basis. This result was made up of $371 million of current quarter losses in 29 events, $57 million of additional losses from events occurring earlier in the year, primarily second quarter hailstorms and a $42 million reduction of prior year reserves. While the catastrophe loss was much less than the first two quarters, it was still relatively high for the third quarter given the absence of a major hurricane loss.
A few words on prior year reserve re-estimates. Besides the $42 million reduction in catastrophe loss re-estimates, the third quarter included a $22 million increase for discontinued lines, primarily for environmental reserves, as we completed our annual reserve study for the discontinued lines for the coverages. It also includes a $70 million litigation accrual charged to homeowners.
On Slide 4, we provide a look at auto loss cost trends which in total remain within our expectations. On the left hand side of the exhibit, we provide the quarterly frequency results for bodily injury and property damage. In both cases, the level of frequency is elevated relative to the previous five years. In the upper right hand corner, we displayed the paid severity change over time. Here the results remain very good with only slight increases in the quarter. When these results are combined with those of the remaining coverages in auto, the result is a combined ratio that is fairly flat for the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009.
On Slide 5, we show similar loss information for Homeowners. On the top half of the exhibit you can see the frequency excluding catastrophe losses was 2.3% less than the third quarter 2009 results. The paid severity, excluding catastrophe losses, increased 2.1% compared to the third quarter of 2009.
With the increase in average earned premium for rate increases working into the results, the underlying loss ratio, which excludes catastrophe losses and prior year reserve re-estimates improved again this quarter. We continue to execute on our profit improvement actions designed to get homeowners to an acceptable level of profitability.
Shifting to Allstate Financial, Slide 6 displays the top and bottom line results for the last two years by quarter. The trends continue to reflect positive momentum in our efforts to produce higher returns, shift our focus to underwritten products versus spread-based products, and serve our customers through Allstate agencies, and the Allstate workplace division. Premium and deposits on underwritten products increased 8.6% compared to the third quarter of 2009, while annuities declined consistent with our strategic direction.
Operating income for the quarter was $108 million or $13 million more than the third quarter of 2009. I would describe this quarter\xe2\x80\x99s result as relatively clean in terms of one-off items. When we adjust the first two quarters of 2010 for these kinds of items, the operating income drops back to a range of $110 million to $115 million for those quarters. The benefit spread was slightly lower due to higher but typical immediate annuity benefits this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009 which had favorable results for that product.
The investment spread increased to $127 million reflecting decreased interest credited to contract holder funds, partly offset by lower net investment income. Operating costs were slightly elevated this quarter due to higher marketing costs and certain acquisition related expenses associated with growth in the workplace division premium. The expense reduction actions associated with the Focus to Win program initiated in 2009 are now substantially complete and the program has met our target.
For the quarter, Allstate Financial recorded net income of $85 million versus a net loss of $38 million last year. Realized capital losses were significantly lower this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009. At this point, I will turn it over to Don.
Don Civgin
Thanks, Bob. I am going to cover our investment performance for the quarter, and the status of our capital position at the end of September.
As you can see on Slide 7, the value of our investment portfolio increased to $102.2 billion in the third quarter, largely reflecting the benefit of the decline in interest rates during the quarter. We continue to be proactive in risk management activities and again this quarter, we reduced exposures in our municipal bond and commercial real estate portfolios while also protecting against an increasing rate environment. We reduced municipal bonds by $2.4 billion of amortized cost in Q3. The reductions targeted sectors and higher risk geographies. Commercial real estate reductions totaled $484 million of amortized cost and this was accomplished through a combination of maturities and prepayments with some offset due to refinancing activity. The total portfolio maintained a defensive position against interest rate increases. Reinvestment proceeds were placed in shorter duration instruments with derivatives being used to further manage the overall duration.
That said, the continuation of lower rates in combination with our risk mitigation and duration management continues to adversely affect investment income.
On Slide 8, you can see that net investment income fell to $1.0 billion, a 4.2% sequential drop and a 7.3% decline from Q3 2009. Property-liability investment income dropped 8.4% sequentially and 12.9% from Q3 2009 on reinvestment of the proceeds from our risk mitigation rate management and investing activities and lower yielding and shorter duration securities as well as the timing of equity dividends.
Allstate Financial investment income dropped 2.2% sequentially and 5% from Q3 2009, primarily the result of a drop in average portfolio balances. Our return optimization program included purchasing high yield corporate and asset-backed securities which have only partially offset the significant decline in interest rates. We continue to focus our investing activity to optimize both risk and return opportunities.
Net realized capital gains and losses shown on the bottom of the slide improved this quarter. We posted a pretax loss of $144 million compared to a loss of $519 million in Q3 2009. Other than temporary impairments were $167 million in the third quarter, less than half the amount experienced in Q3 2009. And they were concentrated primarily in the RMBS and CMBS portfolios.
Trading activity and risk mitigation actions drove net realized capital gains from sales of $319 million in the quarter, $118 million more than last year\xe2\x80\x99s third quarter. Most of the gains came from the fixed income portfolio, in particular, public corporates, municipal bonds, and agency paper. Equities contributed about a third of the gain.
The derivatives loss for this quarter at $285 million was slightly better than the loss in Q2 2010 and $76 million better than Q3 2009. We added additional breakout on this page to show our derivative experience by key risk.
Our interest rate hedges produced a loss of $181 million this quarter, a $100 million less than Q2 2010 and $219 million less than last year. These losses reflected the continued cost of protecting our portfolio from rising interest rates. Our equity hedges lost $115 million as equities rallied about the same as last year\xe2\x80\x99s Q3. All these detail can be found in our 10-Q filing.
On Slide 9, you can see that our unrealized net capital gain position improved by $2.3 billion on a pretax basis from Q2 2010 and is $5 billion better than Q3 2009. After tax and after-tax and DAC we stand at $1.3 billion, $964 million better than Q2 2010. Virtually every asset class participated in this improvement as we benefited this quarter from the declined interest rates and higher equity markets. The improvement in the portfolio valuation more than offset the cost of our risk mitigation programs.
While our net unrealized gain position is clearly a substantial improvement from levels over the past two years in terms of our book value, the current low rate environment that creates this unrealized gain is also the reason we\xe2\x80\x99ve been actively working to reduce exposure rates \xe2\x80\x93 increases in rates.
Finally on slide10, we provide you with a look at our capital position on both the GAAP and Stat basis. Our overall GAAP equity climbed to $19.3 billion in the third quarter, a little more than 15% increase since yearend. Our current estimates of statutory surplus for Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company shows stabled increase in capital levels in these companies.
During the third quarter, the holding company received a $400 million from AIC bringing the total for the year to $600 million. With that I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it back to Tom.
Thomas Wilson
Okay, before we move to your questions, let me summarize the quarter, really with six items. One was disappointing, one was mixed and four were strong performance. Let me start with the disappointing. Our auto retention was down as we started managing in a couple of big states, that offset the benefits from more marketing and the result was that items in a forced and our standard auto business did not grow this quarter. That\xe2\x80\x99s the disappointing part.
The mixed, Homeowners is making progress although we\xe2\x80\x99re still at a high level of (inaudible). In a good category our property liability combined ratio was in the middle of the range that we gave to you in February for both the quarter and the nine months. And this is \xe2\x80\x93 our auto combined ratio has been in the positive zone, that\xe2\x80\x99s below 100 for over a decade.
Investment results, we had great investment results, risk mitigation making a lot of progress on that and our return optimization obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve stated the right stuff as we get a good increase in the value of our portfolio. Allstate Financial is focused to win program is done, and it\xe2\x80\x99s got a balanced approach of raising returns and book value is up 7% for the quarter and 15% for the year.
So that\xe2\x80\x99s a summary of the quarter. Let\xe2\x80\x99s to turn to your questions.
Robert Block
Okay Matt, do you want to start the question and answer session.
Operator
Thank you sir. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Matthew Heimermann from JP Morgan. Your question please.
Matthew Heimermann \xe2\x80\x93 JP Morgan Chase & Co
Hi good morning everybody. Couple of questions, first, just with respect to the policies in force and retention. Could you give a little bit more color maybe on those dates, if not specifically maybe generally that are affecting the retention, and also just would continue to be curious how much of the PIF decline your seeing is also tied to what also be a customer that potentially is leaving because of the homeowners underwriting actions. The second question I have was just on the G&A. I was curious if whether or not there was a tick up in ad spend just because it\xe2\x80\x99s a falling cost for balls (ph) picking up and based all play etcetera. And then the last one quickly was just, there is obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s in the press that America is potentially looking to (inaudible) you\xe2\x80\x99ve been mentioned I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s realistic or not, but be curious what the strategic rational would be for that given its predominant property.
Thomas Wilson
Well thank you Matt, good morning. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take all three of those even though I think 50% of over Bob\xe2\x80\x99s request. I can deal with the last one easier and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll get Joe will take on the states \xe2\x80\x93 question of the state\xe2\x80\x99s retention, what\xe2\x80\x99s happening with homeowners both as we improve property bill and as we seek to increase cross line sales. On the (inaudible) we obviously don\xe2\x80\x99t comment on acquisitions and if we were to buy it, we would have a strategic rationale for it, given that property is not a high focus area for us in terms of growth right now. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put that at the top of anybody\xe2\x80\x99s list.
In terms of ads, we\xe2\x80\x99re doing quite well there. Not only is it just been fall proof policies, we\xe2\x80\x99ve increased our spend to be more competitive as GEICO and Progressive increase their spend. And Joe, do you want to take the retention and growth?
Joseph Lacher
Yes. From a retention in growth perspective Matt, we talked a couple of times in the last couple of quarters about some specific states where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been targeting profitability, focuses, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a little bit of an outline of it in the Q. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some issues in the states we\xe2\x80\x99ve pushed prices up a little bit, some underwriting actions. We see some of that rippling through new business in Florida and California. We see some of that rippling through retention in California and a couple of other states. It\xe2\x80\x99s driven again by trying to get our selection mix from an underwriting perspective in the right spot and getting our pricing where we wanted to be.
From a homeowner\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, there is some impact but not a big impact on the homeowner\xe2\x80\x99s actions that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking. We have talked before about a preferred package discount that we\xe2\x80\x99ve used from a pricing perspective that makes is more attractive to have your auto and home with us and that helps mitigate some of that issue.
Matthew Heimermann \xe2\x80\x93 JP Morgan Chase & Co
Well I guess just to follow, it sounded like even that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about some of these actions that PIF, in your comments at least it sounded like maybe it was a little softer you had hoped it would have been, so I guess if that \xe2\x80\x93 one is that true and if it is, I guess where \xe2\x80\x93 what types of accounts or I guess where is it general across the Board issue or it may be flipped a little bit more or is there some more specific kind of type of customer?
Joseph Lacher
I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to hone in on the part of the follow-up question. If you\xe2\x80\x99re reading that it\xe2\x80\x99s below our expectation from comments this quarter, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly where I\xe2\x80\x99d say it is. We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a little more of a retention impact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in prior quarters and we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing consistent trends on new business with what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not a huge change in the retention impact, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit.
Thomas Wilson
Matt, let me just add one thing to that which is we believe in talking about results in total. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to give you the components of it to make sure you know we understand and you can have a better understanding. On new business, while its up 2%, there are many states where it\xe2\x80\x99s up double-digits. So we just \xe2\x80\x93 so we think our marketing programs are working back to the ads program. And just we\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the number in total.
Matthew Heimermann \xe2\x80\x93 JP Morgan Chase & Co
That\xe2\x80\x99s fair and I guess I would also argue that margins are important too, so.
Thomas Wilson
Thank you, we think so. Totally agree with you.
Matthew Heimermann \xe2\x80\x93 JP Morgan Chase & Co
Sure, bye.
Operator
Our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel from Langen McAlenney. Your question please.
Bob Glasspiegel \xe2\x80\x93 Langen McAlenney
I guess if I could follow-up, good morning, I guess if I could follow-up to Bilbao (ph) question. You\xe2\x80\x99re up to $3.5 billion of cash at the holding company. This acquisition in corporate development factor into where you would stand on initiating a buyback program?
Thomas Wilson
Well I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where this Bilbao drumbeat is coming from but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be us. Let me start with (inaudible) Bob because we all probably talk about it. We obviously have been doing good job of building capital whether that\xe2\x80\x99s statutory capital or book value from a GAAP basis. We feel good about that. As we\xe2\x80\x99ve said the first thing we use with the capital to make sure our business is sound and stable and in a good position and given the economy and investment markets over the last year and a half, we\xe2\x80\x99ve done everything to keep ourselves in the right position and fully capitalize it.
Second then we obviously try to deploy that in growth of the business. The easiest place to do that would be to do it or the less \xe2\x80\x93 the most opportune place would be do it by growing our business organically and we\xe2\x80\x99d love to do that. We\xe2\x80\x99ve also said if there are acquisitions that we think fit, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do those. You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done over time on acquisitions, so we\xe2\x80\x99re not in the market all time buying all kinds of stuff. We do try to buy sensibly what we think will grow us to the workplace business. It was number three when we bought it, its number two now. We\xe2\x80\x99re liking its trend. So we try to be smart about what we buy. And obviously then we return it to the shareholders.
We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked before about our dividend policy which I have my Board look at every quarter. We do that based on sort of a percentage of earnings. I think you should expect to continue to set dividend policy based on the amount of money we make. Then if we have capital above that, then we\xe2\x80\x99ve always bought \xe2\x80\x93 buy a stock, where we\xe2\x80\x99ve not announced a stock buyback program today. I\xe2\x80\x99m not about to because I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling we\xe2\x80\x99re in pretty good shape but if you can look at our track record, I\xe2\x80\x99m giving returning capital to shareholders, it\xe2\x80\x99s been great. So I think you should expect a same philosophy to apply going forward.
Bob Glasspiegel \xe2\x80\x93 Langen McAlenney
Okay, then to just to follow-up your stat cap little went up by I guess $600 million if we add back the dividends which was a decent bit more than your GAAP income this quarter. Do you have \xe2\x80\x93 what were the key drivers of the difference between stat and GAAP?
Thomas Wilson
Are you talking about which entity?
Bob Glasspiegel \xe2\x80\x93 Langen McAlenney
The insurance companies.
Thomas Wilson
The insurance company had an improvement in the unrealized position as well.
Bob Glasspiegel \xe2\x80\x93 Langen McAlenney
Okay. And that that through the stat capital and the unrealized.
Thomas Wilson
Yes, we had \xe2\x80\x93 remember we pick up the improvement in equity at AIC.
Bob Glasspiegel \xe2\x80\x93 Langen McAlenney
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Keith Walsh from Citi. Your question please.
Keith Walsh \xe2\x80\x93 Citi
Hi, good morning, everybody. I guess first for Joe, I saw the press release a few weeks back about the Idaho service center. And I just want to know if this is more indicative of a maybe a more aggressive push into the directs market, maybe you could put a little color around on that why you\xe2\x80\x99re opening that up, and maybe just update us on direct? And I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a follow-up.
Thomas Wilson
Okay. Let me maybe talk first about the call center. We obviously have opened a call center in San Antonio. We opened one in Idaho just recently. That\xe2\x80\x99s in part because not only we do direct business, but we handle all kinds of the service related work on behalf of our agencies, because people want to be there 24/7. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opportunity \xe2\x80\x93 we could open those anywhere in the world. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeking to opening them in the United States at this point as we think it\xe2\x80\x99s just the right thing to do.
When you look at our customers, they say they will think higher of our company that \xe2\x80\x93 a better company that puts jobs in the US even if it costs a little more money. Now, of course, everybody wants a good price, so we have to make sure we continue to use the right kind of labor around the world, which we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very active in. Joe, maybe you want to make a comment about the growth of direct and how it gets in.
Joseph Lacher
Yes. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll echo the same things. We use all our service center capabilities to service multiple channels, so this is not purely related to direct. We are growing our direct business and are enthusiastic about those prospects and continue to do so. I think we gave you a little bit of information in the Q.
As you can see, that business was growing north of 15% for us in the quarter and we feel good about it, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to keep our marketing and our operational capabilities lined up to facilitate doing that more so. We want to service customers in the ways they want to be serviced and meet their needs and the value propositions that resonate with them, and that will continue to be a focus for us as long as it is for customers.
Thomas Wilson
Hi Keith, this is Tom. I think sometimes \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to reiterate, underline and expand a little bit about something that Joe said. When you look at \xe2\x80\x93 the key thing is to look at the customer segment and say what is it that they want and make sure to you\xe2\x80\x99re delivering.
So there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole bunch of customers who want a personal touch from somebody, who want a relationship, and we have a CC who can do that quite well with our agencies. There are other people who are more self-directed and wanted to direct. So we try to deal with customers as to how they want to \xe2\x80\x93 a lot of time as people get focused on distribution without focusing on the customer. We think you got to focus on the customer first, then figure out what distribution works for them.
Keith Walsh \xe2\x80\x93 Citi
Okay. And then, Tom, my second question just more broadly, the inconsistency in the results is clearly an outlier to your peers. Can you help us understand why that is, because I\xe2\x80\x99m just having a hard time with that? Thanks.
Thomas Wilson
Maybe if you can give me a little clarification on inconsistency.
Keith Walsh \xe2\x80\x93 Citi
Inconsistency, you got weather related losses this quarter. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that out of TRV or PGR. The PIF numbers are clearly up and down sequentially when we look at it. The overall earnings results is just pretty inconsistent across the board. So we can go on and on offline if you want, but maybe we can start there.
Thomas Wilson
It sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re frustrated, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for that. What I can tell you is that we give you a combined ratio for the year that\xe2\x80\x99s ex-cats in prior reserves releases, which of course are impossible to forecast. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been dead in the middle of that or as long as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing. And so I feel good about 89.2.
As it relates to catastrophe losses, when you are as broad as we are across the country, you subject to all those. So some of the companies you mentioned have a more narrower focus in terms of where their homeowners businesses.
Keith Walsh \xe2\x80\x93 Citi
Okay, thanks.

Our next question is from Alison Jacobowitz from Bank of America. Your question please.
Alison Jacobowitz \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America
Hi, thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the frequency in auto this quarter, it sequentially seems to spike up a little bit with 7% in a couple of areas. And also, if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible, could you give us some color on the growth. I know that several states are holding you back. Can you clarify a little bit of this if you can where you are in that process or where you think are and when that pressure might start to ease up?
Thomas Wilson
Why don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x93 Joe, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take both of those.
Joseph Lacher
Relative to the frequency, Alison, we are seeing a bit of an uptick in frequency. We are \xe2\x80\x93 continue to look at it. It\xe2\x80\x99s generally spread across a broad set of geographies, across a broad set of customer vintages if you will, 10 year we have with customers, and across most ways that we can look at it.
We are seeing a little bit of that spike, be an increase in claims that are closed without payments, which might be a little bit of a tail impact on some of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in prior periods.
We made a big shift in our claim system over the past couple of years, which is at the \xe2\x80\x93 which is done basically, but it does impact some of the prior period claim practices. So a little bit of that frequency we think there might be some noise out of that. But even if you take the noise out, there is a bit of an uptick.
We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some increases in gas purchases and miles driven which would be some correlation to that. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure where to point where we declared a long-term trend, but we\xe2\x80\x99re watching it.
Relative to the growth question, we don\xe2\x80\x99t give forward-looking growth guidance or production guidance. What I will tell you is that we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on over the long term growing our business.
We are focused on preserving a strong track record of having very powerful margins and we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep those two items in mind as we march forward. I think in the comments we\xe2\x80\x99ve given you is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got new business up double digits in states other than California and Florida where we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing new business decline year-over-year.
We focused on some specific profitability actions in those geographies and that will work its way through the system at least the new business relative to the year-over-year. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about this for three quarters, so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a year-over-year problem in another quarter or a quarter-and-a-half, that\xe2\x80\x99s just algebra.
But in terms of where we\xe2\x80\x99re projecting going forward, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to avoid doing that.
Alison Jacobowitz \xe2\x80\x93 Bank of America

Our next question is from Paul Newsome of Sandler O\xe2\x80\x99Neill. Your question please.
Paul Newsome \xe2\x80\x93 Sandler O\xe2\x80\x99Neill
Great, and good morning. I apologize if I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed it, but the little litigation charge that was in home insurance what was that and maybe you could talk about the A&E charge as well.
Thomas Wilson
I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a quick \xe2\x80\x93 Paul, this time, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a quick uptake on the lawsuit and Don maybe you want to take A&E. As it relates to lawsuit it was a potential class action suit in filed in a state court. You\xe2\x80\x99ll remember that they changed this Class Action Fairness Act which removed class action some state courts to federal courts, because we thought that we know that federal courts deal with them in a more balanced approach.
This is one of the ones we had left that was from a state court, it was down in Texarkana, Arkansas. It was related to the way in which we calculate the amount paid to fix homeowners\xe2\x80\x99 claims. A number of other carriers that work for us down in that court had settled claim, had settled their amounts at what we think are amounts higher than, and this actually would cover 48 states, because we won this issue in many any other states, just in this particular state court we thought it was better to settle and move on.
Don Civgin
And on the A&E Paul, we do an annual analysis of those reserves. And we \xe2\x80\x93 as in previous years, we did it this year and added about $18 million.
Paul Newsome \xe2\x80\x93 Sandler O\xe2\x80\x99Neill
Any reason for that?
Don Civgin
No particular reason, no. No specific reason.
Thomas Wilson
It may sound like we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some big claim out there or some are worried about. As you remember in the environmental thing, I think about 65%, 70% of its \xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x99re incurred by not reported. So off the amount we have up for environmental, we don\xe2\x80\x99t actually have specific claims. But if you\xe2\x80\x99ll look at the trends what comes in, what you have to payout and you make changes. And in this day and age, you put a point and you see it.
Paul Newsome \xe2\x80\x93 Sandler O\xe2\x80\x99Neill
I\xe2\x80\x99d like to if you could focus on the Encompass brand and the efforts that \xe2\x80\x93 a little bit more in the efforts you are trying to make that more profitable and maybe talk a little bit about the sort of the long-term viability of that operation. This has been I believe a certainly a not less profitable in the core business for as long as I can remember.
Thomas Wilson
Paul, let me have Joe take that as to where it say. But let me just say from a standpoint, remember we bought that business back in 1999, we\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at it every which way to Sunday and we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a good return on that business because we bought it so cheap.
Paul Newsome \xe2\x80\x93 Sandler O\xe2\x80\x99Neill
Cheap is good.
Joseph Lacher
So, when we look at it, Paul. I would encourage you to think about the Encompass business right now is having sort of two parts in it. There is core target that it has long been its target of a bundled auto and home targeting sort of a mass affluent customer base below the real high end that you see in some high value at homeowners players. And we do well in that product. It does \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s positioned well inside of agencies, they like the product, they like its performance. We sit into a well-defined niche there. And broadly, are happy with the performance, on any given day, any given quarter we might want it do a little bit better whether its growth or profitability. Then there is a second part of the business, a couple of years ago we tried to expand our targeting to produce more auto business through that brand, we ended up adding groups of agencies that were more specialize in auto, broaden the product capability to target that monoline auto.
And it sounds that our approach both for a combination of distribution and a combination of how we priced and structured the product and managed the underwriting wasn\xe2\x80\x99t effective in that marketplace. And it hurt us from a profitability perspective. What you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing right now running through the numbers is the impacts of unwinding that latter part of the book of business. Now as we do that it had a little bit of ripple over effect into the quarter. So that\xe2\x80\x99s getting splashed with the cleanup if you will, as we move through that we will continue and are continuing to focus on the core niche were Encompass has been effective.
I\xe2\x80\x99m very confident that we can be effective in that space, grow that business, make reasonable returns on it. And then it\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s desired by independent agents as distributor and has a customer proposition. We just have to finish the cleanup of that auto specialist strategy.
Paul Newsome \xe2\x80\x93 Sandler O\xe2\x80\x99Neill
Is this split 50-50 or is it, how big is one versus the other?
Joseph Lacher
It got as big at one point as close to 50-50. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to decline to give you the specifics on exactly where it is right now.
Paul Newsome \xe2\x80\x93 Sandler O\xe2\x80\x99Neill

Our next question comes from Cliff Gallant from KBW. Your question please.
Cliff Gallant \xe2\x80\x93 Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods
Good morning. Two questions, one the ad spending, the elevated level that we saw in the quarter. Should we expect that going forward? And then two, during the quarter State Farm had an announcement regarding drywall lawsuits and it looked like they were trying to move towards some kind of settlement. And I was wondering if you had any update on that issue?
Thomas Wilson
Good morning Cliff. In terms of the ad spend you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen us increase at this quarter because we felt that was worthwhile to take the risk and see what kind of growth we get, as long as we keep in growth out of it, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep doing it. When we think it\xe2\x80\x99s not economic, then we won\xe2\x80\x99t do it. As it relates to drywall, we don\xe2\x80\x99t really have anything to talk about other than what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said publicly before which is we don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is exposure. If you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Chinese drywall, we don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is just always we think to say product liability issue not a homeowner issue.

Our next question is from Meyer Shields from Stifel Nicolaus. Your question please.
Meyer Shields \xe2\x80\x93 Stifel Nicolaus
Thanks. I want to drill down a little bit into a comment that you made about wanting long-term growth in Allstate brand. I know if we look back about a year a year plus, the capital was really constrained and I think that translated into a focus on maximizing current underwriting profits probably at the expense of growth. If I understand you correctly, is that concerned now waiting so that you can focus more currently on growth?
Thomas Wilson
So it\xe2\x80\x99s really a cap of question Meyer, let me take it which is if you have follow-up as to what you think, what Joe was doing up, we should go there as well. But as it relates to capital you\xe2\x80\x99re correct in the assumption that we\xe2\x80\x99ve \xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we felt capital was constrained, everyone has got their own word around that. But we ran comfortable with the economic or investment outlook really starting in 2008. So at that point we chose to protect margins at the expense of growth. You are seeing the consequences of that both in \xe2\x80\x9809 and \xe2\x80\x9810 as we try to work through that because this has long trends in it, you can\xe2\x80\x99t sort it, because so much of our businesses renewal, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to kind of turn that thing on a dime.
But you are correct in sort of what you see today. Do you have anything more specific on the growth that you want Joe to answer?
Meyer Shields \xe2\x80\x93 Stifel Nicolaus
I think so, in the past you\xe2\x80\x99ve given ratios of competitor rate increases, decreases in auto and how you saw that playing out. I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s still trending positively?
Joseph Lacher
Can you expand that a little bit, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make sure I understand that how you\xe2\x80\x99re asking the question.
Meyer Shields \xe2\x80\x93 Stifel Nicolaus
I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering is whether your expectation for the next, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know short term, call it 12 months is that your competitive profile will improve due to other companies rate increases?
Joseph Lacher
That becomes yes a hard one for us to say here in this environment and forecast for you both what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do from a pricing perspective and what other folks are going to do from a pricing perspective. I\xe2\x80\x99d love at a date forecast it because we\xe2\x80\x99d find that to be useful. But from a competitive perspective I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a conversation could be tough for us to have here.
Meyer Shields \xe2\x80\x93 Stifel Nicolaus
Okay, thanks very much.

Our next question is from Brian Meredith from UBS. Your question please.
Brian Meredith \xe2\x80\x93 UBS
Yes, good morning. I guess just quickly here, the underwriting expenses are in the property casualty area up about 10% in the quarter, up 12% last quarter. Is that the ad spend coming through or is there anything else running through there?
Don Civgin
Pension costs too.
Brian Meredith \xe2\x80\x93 UBS
Pension cost, okay. How much of the pension cost addition?
Don Civgin
I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we disclose it but if you want to follow-up with Bob, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to give it to you.
Brian Meredith \xe2\x80\x93 UBS
Okay, great. And then so quickly if I take a look at average rate and premium per policy, the year-over-year growth kind of decelerated in the quarter. Is that just a function of just getting more competitive out there from a rate perspective at Allstate? Is there something else that I am missing?
Thomas Wilson
If you look at the, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost a follow-up to the prior conversation, now we\xe2\x80\x99re looking through the back windows.
Brian Meredith \xe2\x80\x93 UBS
Yes.
Thomas Wilson
opposed to the forward one. Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it before and we have been a little more focused on being more competitive sometimes, in some cases that\xe2\x80\x99s being taking rates down, in other cases it\xe2\x80\x99s been not taking them up at the same rate we have before. And that the bulk of what\xe2\x80\x99s driven through there.
Brian Meredith \xe2\x80\x93 UBS
Got you. And then the last one, Tom you made reference to the customer loyalty kind of being down a little bit in the quarter. Can you talk about initiatives right now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten place to try to keep that kind of moving up, that are headed into other direction?
Thomas Wilson
Yes, Brian same things we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing which is \xe2\x80\x93 first it was a down a little.
Brian Meredith \xe2\x80\x93 UBS
Yes.
Thomas Wilson
So you get into, I just think it was missed opportunity because everybody else was down too and we need to move it up because if we move it up, retention will go up. If retention goes up growth will go up and that will be good for all of us. The programs we have in place just to refresh your memory, we changed their reward system, so both our agencies and our employees benefit from higher customer loyalty. Agencies in that some of their bonuses pay down retention. Our employees and that the profit sharing plan is down, we switch it from profits to customer loyalty. So people for 1K matches dependent getting up. So we have the reward side.
On the accountability side, we\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to increase the accountability for results and if people don\xe2\x80\x99t take good care of our customers and they can\xe2\x80\x99t be part of our team. We also have a number of programs underway, underneath that to help us improve loyalty, everything from calling people doing protection reviews, calling them when their bill is late to having better and clear communication with watch themselves called insurance made simple. So there is a whole bunch of things we do along the way which support both accountability and recognition.
One of the challenges we had this quarter was the benefit of all those programs, rewards, accountability and new initiatives did not offset the impact that reasonably large increases in price had in a couple of the big states. So as price goes up, obviously people get unhappy. And you have to make them even more happy and we just didn\xe2\x80\x99t accomplish that. That said, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t make as much progress in the other parts of the country as we need to. So it will stay a big focus for us.
Brian Meredith \xe2\x80\x93 UBS

Our next question is from Vinay Misquith from Credit Suisse. Your question please.
Vinay Misquith \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse
Hi good morning. The first question is on the capital position. Stock capital has increased nearly $2 billion since the end of 2008, and your GAAP capital has increased $8 billion. Just curious about whether in fact that you\xe2\x80\x99ve announced to buyback, has that been held back by the S&P negative outlook and are you waiting for that to be removed before you make them to announcement on that front?
Thomas Wilson
Vinay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a quick comment, and Don may want to make a comment as well. We are appreciative of the recognition that capital has gone up and we think it is a big thing and it should be driving shareholder value more than it is. And at current book value multiples, we are in my estimation a bargain. But as it relates to capital levels, we run it based on what we think, not what other people think.
So our \xe2\x80\x93 we set up capital, we look at economic capital and we think we have plenty of economic capital. We have, S&P can have a negative outlook I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why given that we think we have excess capital as to obviously you and other people on this call. So their outlook is not keeping us back from doing anything, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need their approval to buy back shares or pay dividend or do anything else.
Vinay Misquith \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse
Fair enough. So what\xe2\x80\x99s rolling back from buying back stock right now?
Thomas Wilson
Just that where we started, which is all things hit the right time.
Vinay Misquith \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse
Okay. The follow-up question is in terms of the actions taken to improve profitability, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s had a negative impact our retention in California, Georgia, New York and North Carolina, and also in Florida. Can you give us a sense for what inning are we in terms of rate increases, or in terms of these actions taken to improve profitability?
Thomas Wilson
I think Joe answered that which is we don\xe2\x80\x99t look forward, we increase prices when we think we need to. There is a number of trends that are, each of our states is different, you remember in California we had to take some big decreases I think in 2008. And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve not even back to where we were when we got started with this. In some of the bigger states that have personal injury protection, you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a number of industry things going on where fraud is way up in places like Florida and New York. So it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to predict what inning you\xe2\x80\x99re in. I can only tell you that our approach in what Joe and his team do is when they see a problem, they go and fix it.
And we try to keep balance, we try to keep rate increases small as opposed to large and infrequent and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do the same thing in the future.
Vinay Misquith \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse
And on the homeowner\xe2\x80\x99s side, the trailing 12 month rate increases seemed to be only 6%. Do you think that you would like to take a higher rate increase given that the combined ratio was 100% this quarter in homeowners?
Thomas Wilson
I\xe2\x80\x99ve been consistent in saying we need to get a better return from it.
Vinay Misquith \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse
Okay, and what\xe2\x80\x99s the timeline that you propose to take rates up in that line?
Don Civgin
We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to go.
Thomas Wilson
We don\xe2\x80\x99t give projections on what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.
Vinay Misquith \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse
Okay, alright. Thank you.
Thomas Wilson
It is useful Vinay that remember that the homeowners had the litigation settlement that ran through that number this quarter. So that\xe2\x80\x99s a significant number we had.
Vinay Misquith \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse
Yes, that four points on the combined ratio and the combined ratio was 104.7. So even if you take that out, that\xe2\x80\x99s a 100%. This quarter I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was a really bad quarter in terms of cash. So I am a little surprised that it was 100%. And so I was just wondering whether you plan to take rates up, say maybe 10% in that line to get it more to the high 80s, low 90s combined ratio.
Thomas Wilson
Vinay, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very consistent saying we need a lower combined ratio, higher return and homeowners, I think actually when I summarized the quarter, I said that that was \xe2\x80\x93 it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in my disappointing, it was in my mixed category. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at the four positives but we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t like you can just wave a magic want and all of a sudden charge people a lot more money given the regulatory structure and the customer relationships we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to manage. So we try to do it on a balanced way. Joe talked earlier about the success we\xe2\x80\x99re having with giving larger discounts on auto insurance to monoline, homeowner customers, that\xe2\x80\x99s working quite well for us. So we want to do this is in a way that accelerates the overall growth of the company and both in terms of the size of the company as well as improve returns.
Vinay Misquith \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse
Okay, fair enough. Thank you.

Our next question is from Greg Locraft from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
Greg Locraft \xe2\x80\x93 Morgan Stanley
Hi thanks. I wanted to cover a couple of things. Number one, how are you feeling on the pension at this point in time, it was underfunded by over $1 billion at the end of last year?
Thomas Wilson
We obviously have plenty of cash. So of course I would tell that we go good about the pension and that it\xe2\x80\x99s an obligation of the company, we put a lot more money into it this year. And we obviously have plenty of capital to keep the pension hold. So it depends what you mean feel about the pension. We obviously would like returns to go up on that portfolio and we\xe2\x80\x99ve had good returns so far this year but we\xe2\x80\x99re like everybody else, we still suffer from the downturn in equity values that happened really last three or four years. Don, you have any other comments you want to.
Don Civgin
No, nothing else.
Greg Locraft \xe2\x80\x93 Morgan Stanley
Okay, great. And just if you could refresh, how much will you put into the pension this year and then how are you thinking about funding, from a company contribution perspective next year?
Don Civgin
Let us follow-up on that Greg. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t remember.
Thomas Wilson
Yes, you can \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99ve funded when we needed. There is obviously a tax advantage to putting money in early and letting it roll but then the downside to it is you lose a little bit of investment income of the company. But you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about our contributions have usually have been in the hundreds and millions of dollars. So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s not a meaningful numbers in terms of the overall operating income of the company.
Greg Locraft \xe2\x80\x93 Morgan Stanley
Okay, great. Second, is the debt level of the company, you guys have done a nice job deleveraging for several quarters now, how low do you think this could go? I mean I think your target is low 20s and it seems like you guys are getting pretty darn close to that right now.
Thomas Wilson
I guess if you do the math on GAAP, that\xe2\x80\x99s how it gets to deleveraging. If you do the math on economics, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been right where we\xe2\x80\x99ve always been and on GAAP its 23.5 when we all said that feels probably right, we obviously don\xe2\x80\x99t have need for extra capital today. So we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to go and borrow it down. It\xe2\x80\x99s always looking at how he wants to optimize our capital structure and both that\xe2\x80\x99s within the existing $6 billion of debt or any \xe2\x80\x93 whether he wants to move out of the things. And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen us do that over time everything from issue preferreds to debt and tied to overall capital of the company, because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any plans, we\xe2\x80\x99re not announcing anything today as to what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do.
Greg Locraft \xe2\x80\x93 Morgan Stanley
I guess I was just wondering, is that 23.5, I mean is there a governor below which you guys would, I guess take out more debt in order to kind of hold the ratio flat, or do you not \xe2\x80\x93 do you look at it more or less, you don\xe2\x80\x99t look at it as much on a GAAP basis, is what you\xe2\x80\x99re implying?
Don Civgin
That\xe2\x80\x99s right.
Greg Locraft \xe2\x80\x93 Morgan Stanley
Okay, great. Last is on the investment income line, that was one of the ones that we were sort of surprised on. And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering how do we think about modeling that going forward? How much is coming due or maturing and what does the new reinvestment rate looks like?
Thomas Wilson
Judy is so happy, she got a question.
Judy Greffin
Yes.
Thomas Wilson
Because she has been sitting here patiently waiting for someone to jump on it. Well we thought maybe Don had done such a good job of explaining to you, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any questions. Judy?
Judy Greffin
So maturities are I believe disclosed on page eight of the notes. So you can take a look there and see what we\xe2\x80\x99ve got coming off over the next several years. With regard to income and many factors affecting investment income. First, we\xe2\x80\x99re in a low-rate environment, rates are down as everybody knows 100 to 150 basis points, 50 basis points in the quarter alone. We also have our proactive stand on risk mitigations and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing that for a couple of years. We think it gives us a lot of flexibility in the portfolio better positions us going forward. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused largely on commercial real estate and municipals for the past year or so. And I\xe2\x80\x99d say that those programs are largely complete.
We\xe2\x80\x99ve also done some durations, shortening or duration management within the portfolio and this quarter in particular we took a hard look at the cash duration in the property and casualty portfolio and made some moves to shorten the cash duration, because we felt we were using a derivatives to a great extent more than we needed to in that portfolio and decided to bring down the cash duration and that impacted the income as well. And then just normal trading activity in this low rate environment also impacted investment income. When you look at how to manage it going forward, you talk to any portfolio manager that has fixed income in their portfolio, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a situation where rates are low, they could stay low for an extended period of time. And then you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at less income as a portfolio manager.
Rates could decline further which value of the portfolio would go up but you end up with earning less and then if rates rise, the values of portfolio could fall \xe2\x80\x93 would fall but you\xe2\x80\x99d earn more income and I guess, the actions that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking put us in a position where we feel that we have the flexibility to be proactive in managing the portfolio and driving shareholder value.

Okay, thanks, very thorough. A follow-up on that is the increase in the expense line that goes into this and this is just on the P&C side, is that because of the unwind of derivatives, or I didn\xe2\x80\x99t fully explain how the lack of using derivatives caused this number to step down so much.
Thomas Wilson
What expense line are you talking, are you talking about underwriting expense, are you talking about investment expense?
Greg Locraft \xe2\x80\x93 Morgan Stanley
I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about investment expense, it went up I think $3 million year-over-year which was a heck of a jump if you look at the last several quarters in the supplement.
Robert Block
This is Bob. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you and I talk about that offline and we can get behind those numbers.
Greg Locraft \xe2\x80\x93 Morgan Stanley
Okay. So the two \xe2\x80\x93 the number you put up though is much more indicative of what the future run rate is going to be out of investment income and then we can model the maturities, and reinvestment rate per your guidance?
Thomas Wilson
You can model it, I would take out per guidance. I mean as Judy said what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do is manage for total return in an environment that could go flat out, go up, go down and we\xe2\x80\x99ve shortened duration we\xe2\x80\x99re staying on the balls of our feet so that we can move quickly, but and harvesting gains, because we\xe2\x80\x99re not just writing it down and having the gains and have the gains go away if interest rates go up, we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to protect ourselves if they do.
Greg Locraft \xe2\x80\x93 Morgan Stanley
Okay, great. Thanks guys.

Our next question is from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.
Josh Shanker \xe2\x80\x93 Deutsche Bank
Thank you. Given the pace of frequency trends in auto I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the rate actions you have taken, prior are anticipating these frequency increases, or where we stand in terms of your current rate outlook related to what frequency is doing?
Joseph Lacher
I\xe2\x80\x99d love to tell you that we can look forward, six to nine months and figure out what frequency is going to do, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t. The actions we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken in the past are functions of what we thought was going on and maybe a short term view of where we think frequency might be headed. My comments before suggested that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing some of these increases in the relatively recent periods parts of them, when we look period-over-period we think are little bit attributable to the claim system changes we made over the past couple of years and parts of it appeared to be more broad and environment. And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to watch and see what\xe2\x80\x99s happening with those trends, see if in fact they are trends if they\xe2\x80\x99re near term anomaly. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll factor that into our pricing approach which will include all the things we talked about in terms of managing margins and thinking about how we run this business relative to the entire impact of the corporation.
Thomas Wilson
Hey Josh, its Tom. In a longer-term basis, I think for 20 years, if you look at 20 years frequency came down as we\xe2\x80\x99ve got safer cars and better drunk driving laws, older drivers, more cars per household. The whole bunch of things drove that trend. If you look over the shorter period of time, it looks much flatter. So that puts Joe\xe2\x80\x99s comments in perspective, 2010 looks like 2007.
Josh Shanker \xe2\x80\x93 Deutsche Bank
That\xe2\x80\x99s good. And so thinking then about the competitive nature of the market with the rates environment where it is, coming into the New Year I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re doing some budgeting. Given the seasonality of shopping behavior and I know you guys have a new ad campaign out there that\xe2\x80\x99s running a lot. Are you planning on increasing the budget for advertising for first quarter \xe2\x80\x98011?
Thomas Wilson
That would be a competitive piece of information we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to give out.
Josh Shanker \xe2\x80\x93 Deutsche Bank
Okay, well thank you very much.

Our final question today is from Sarah DeWitt from Barclays Capital. Question please.
Sarah DeWitt \xe2\x80\x93 Barclays Capital
Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow-up about your appetite for M&A. Can you elaborate on this and talk about if you have any desire to expand internationally, because there have been some reports about Allstate being interested in RBS\xe2\x80\x99s PNC business. Thank you.
Thomas Wilson
Good morning Sarah, this is Tom. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to what has been our stock answer for that which isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be very specific to what you asked, which is we look at everything that comes across the market, sometimes we got out proactively look for stuff, we tend to be relatively conservative in the price we will pay unless, and try to only buy things when we think we can add lots of values. So when bought the Workplace Division a decade ago, we thought we could expand it geographically across the country. When we did that, we thought we\xe2\x80\x99d get expanded to sales of Allstate agencies, we did that. We thought we could expand it from small carrier, small companies to large companies, we did that. And when we bought CNA business had a combined ratio of 117, and while Joe\xe2\x80\x99s is not happy with its combine ratio at 100.
It\xe2\x80\x99s been substantially below 100 since we bought it and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made good money on that. So that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of the approach we have. If you \xe2\x80\x93 to answer your question about international versus domestic. Much more interested in take \xe2\x80\x93 ceasing the opportunity available in the domestic market than international. But if something was appropriately priced and we thought we could add value, we always look at it.
Sarah DeWitt \xe2\x80\x93 Barclays Capital
Great, thanks for the answer.
Thomas Wilson
Okay, thank you all for taking the time. We are sticking with our strategy, being focused on the customer and its driving all of our activity both with Joe and his team at Allstate Protection with Matt and his team at Allstate Financial. And we\xe2\x80\x99re being active and risk mitigation and return optimization with Judy and her team. So all that productivity has created more shareholder value. So book value again is up this quarter and we feel good about that. So we have a great management team. We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to success, work successfully to increase the value of your investment. Thank you and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see you next quarter.
