Welcome to the Aflac 2016 Outlook Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, today\xe2\x80\x99s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, you may begin.
Robin Wilkey
Good morning and welcome to our 2016 outlook call. Joining me this morning from the U.S. is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President of Aflac Incorporated; Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S.; and Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer. Also from Tokyo joining us today is Paul Amos, President of Aflac; Hiroshi Yamauchi, President and COO of Aflac Japan.
Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at these quarterly earnings releases for some of the various risk factors that can materially impact our results.
Now, I will turn the program over to Dan who will begin this morning with some high level comments and outlines of the company\xe2\x80\x99s strategic vision. Then Paul will provide the strategic focus for our Japan operations and outlook, Teresa will give an update on the U.S. strategy and focus; and Fred will follow up with comments about our capital management strategy and financial outlook and then Dan will follow up at the end. Dan?
Dan Amos
Good morning and thank you for joining us. Many of you probably heard me speak about the importance of the promises that we make to our policyholders and being there when they need us most. Today, we are going to share with you our outlook for 2016. But before we do, I would like to share Aflac\xe2\x80\x99s strategic vision to offer higher quality voluntary products, solutions and services through diverse distribution outlets. In doing so, we are ultimately building upon our market leading position to drive long-term shareholder value.
At Aflac, we have always managed our business for the long-term, while maintaining a sharp focus on the financial objectives. At the same time, we continue to work on enhancing our customer service and building our book of business. In doing so, we successfully established strategic points of leverage in both Japan and the United States that we will use to grow and drive shareholder value. Our industry leading market share and scale in both Japan and the United States drive our administrative efficiencies. This allows us to offer affordable and value coverage to our customers and competitive compensation to our distributors. At the same time, it drives value for our shareholders. Leveraging our leading position in both countries will help position us for growth going forward.
As product innovator, we have experienced a tremendous amount of success in leveraging the strength of Aflac\xe2\x80\x99s recognition and powerful brand to drive sales. About 9 out of 10 people in both countries recognize the Aflac brand. Our brand is a combination of many elements with the most visible being the Aflac Duck. But it\xe2\x80\x99s also made up of trust that we have built through relationships with businesses, the policyholders and consumers. In Japan and the U.S., Aflac\xe2\x80\x99s established brand has served as an effective door opener. In turn, this serves as a catalyst for customers to be more receptive to hearing how Aflac\xe2\x80\x99s products can help them. That\xe2\x80\x99s just one example in The United States, One Day Pay, our industry leading claims initiatives allows us to process, approve and pay eligible claims in just one day. Our policyholders and consumers continue to tell us how our commitment to paying claims pass through One Day Pay underscores Aflac\xe2\x80\x99s integrity and commitment to delivering on our promise.
Having diverse and productive distribution channels is a strategic point of leverage and a vital component of our growth strategy in Japan and in the United States. As such, this is one area that we focused a great deal of our efforts. Our goal is to have a presence in all outlets where consumers in both countries want to make their insurance person\xe2\x80\x99s decisions. We offer innovative products and high-quality customized service to provide businesses and their employees with solutions that protect financial well-being.
We have established a strong capital position with stable earnings and cash flow. Our capital ratios demonstrate our commitment to maintaining strong capital levels and flexibility on behalf of our policyholders, bondholders and shareholders. We also regularly assess our capital adequacy to ensure we maintain strong even under economic scenarios.
Now, let me turn the program over to Paul who will talk about Aflac Japan. Paul?
Paul Amos
Thank you, Dan. Japan faces the unprecedented challenges of keeping its economy running against the backdrop of social change and reform. As you are aware, Japanese economy has recently dipped into a technical recession. At the same time, Japan\xe2\x80\x99s government is under increasing financial strain to support a growing number of retirees. Given Japan\xe2\x80\x99s aging population, declining birth rate and rising medical treatment cost, the healthcare system has been under increasing financial pressure. These factors present an opportunity as health-related expenditures continue to grow so does the need for insurance across all ages, especially the type of products we offer, Insurance for Daily Living. We believe Aflac\xe2\x80\x99s products are more vital than ever before and we are committed to being there for our policyholders in their time of need.
Another factor of social change in Japan relates to womenomics or the increased participation of women in the workforce. Womenomics represents the primary way the government is attempting to address challenges of a shrinking workforce. At Aflac Japan, diversity management is an integral part of our overall management strategy. For example, last year, we implemented a comprehensive leadership initiative called the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Empowerment program and we are working to raise the percentage of leadership positions held by women. Research from various sources, including McKinsey Consulting, has proven that diverse organizations deliver better financial results, which will impact both Japan\xe2\x80\x99s economy and continue to help Aflac Japan.
Turning to the third sector market with many insurance companies seeing growth opportunities, the landscape remains competitive. While the number of competitors has decreased, medical product competitiveness is on the rise with an increasing variety of products that have shorter lifecycles. At the same time, the ongoing low interest rate environment has created changes in the first sector marketplace. Amid this evolving market environment, Aflac is determined to maintain and further expand its position as the leading insurance company in Japan\xe2\x80\x99s third sector market by providing solutions for our policyholders as they face a heavy financial burden related to healthcare cost.
In 2015, Aflac Japan significantly expanded its third sector product sales and distribution. Notably, we strengthened our relationship with Japan Post Holdings. With respect to third sector products, you will recall at the end of 2014, Aflac Japan introduced the latest version through our cancer product line, New Cancer DAYS and its strong momentum continued into 2015 across all distribution channels. Then in June 2015, we enhanced our EVER medical insurance with the introduction of riders related to critical illnesses. As we have experienced in the past, the launch of these two significant products serve to boost sales in 2015. We anticipate that in 2016 the new product schedule will focus on product refinements, including the potential to enter a new area of the third sector market.
In terms of first sector products the market is further segmented at a level premium protection oriented products are largely sold in traditional channels and lump-sum savings oriented products are popular in the bank channel. We are refining our approach and will concentrate on level premium products for cross-selling and stability of returns. The goal is to split this sector into those products that we want to sell based on their characteristics, profitability and limited capital strain. The low interest rate environment has impacted our view on selling first sector products. And the action we took in 2012, in terms of limiting the sale of WAYS for instance was the right path for us to take.
Going forward, we believe the sale of level premium products not only enhances the sale of third sector products through cross-selling, but importantly the product profitability of these level premium products is more stable with returns that exceed our cost of capital and benefit from the cross-sell of higher return third sector products. Given the very strong sales growth in the first nine months and our expectation for the remainder of the year, we now anticipate that 2015 sales growth for third sector products will be at the high end of the 10% to 13% range. The successful launch of two products in the cancer and health lines created difficult 2015 sales comparisons. As such, we anticipate third sector sales in 2016 will be down mid single-digits.
While these results from 2015 create a tough comparison, we are looking to drive a compound annual growth rate for third sector products in the range of 4% to 6% over the long-term. We believe that a continued revision and expansion of our third sector product line will aid in achieving this objective. With respect to first sector sales, 2016 will be a year of transition, making specific guidance more challenging. We expect our proactive approach will drive lump-sum product sales down considerably, while level premium products will essentially track third sector sales down modestly during the year. Recognizing we have an Aflac policy in one out of four households in Japan, we pay careful attention to the social change and have a track record of developing products and solutions to meet the evolving needs of our customers.
Thank you. And now let me turn it over to Teresa White, who will be covering Aflac U.S.
Teresa White
Thank you, Paul. I would like to begin by sharing some highlights of what we are observing in the U.S. market, much of which has been impacted by the Affordable Care Act or ACA. We continue to see employers opt for high deductible health plan to reduce expenses associated with offering employee benefits. Although small employers meaning those fewer than 50 employees are not required to offer major medical, they continue to look for ways to assist their employees with health coverage. In addition, mid to large employers are still overwhelmed by the regulatory aspects of ACA. These employers are seeking ways to make coverage affordable, while at the same time reduce the administrative burden of the regulations. Nevertheless, workers continue to look to employers for healthcare solutions, especially since 52% of U.S. workers can\xe2\x80\x99t even afford $1,000 out-of-pocket expenses. This dynamic has caused many brokers to look to volunteer to help their clients to fill gaps brought by a high deductible health plan.
From a competitive standpoint, the U.S. market remains very dynamic and has been subject to continual change. Group players are entering the voluntary markets by either shifting some of their employees paid offerings to voluntary or are creating voluntary products of their own. The ACA has introduced new rules and greater complexity, especially in HR processes, which has led to an increased administrative burden to the employer. In response, this has prompted a renewed focus on technology to help with decision support, HR benefits enrollment and to help employees to navigate the complex healthcare systems. This environment creates additional opportunities for Aflac, which leads me to our strategic playbook for 2016.
Now as a backdrop, our goal in 2015 was to build out our two channel distribution model more specifically, by clarifying roles within each channel. Historically, these channels have competed, which created channel conflict. To manage this, we have leveraged the strength of each channel. We have been focusing our career agents on the smaller employers, since they typically enjoy the most success by certain employers with less than 50 employees. Here, we are using Everwell to drive growth. And I will talk a little bit more about this in a few minutes. For the mid-to-large case market, we are attracting more brokers than ever before. In fact, the strong performance in many of our successful market operations is due in part to increased collaboration between brokers and career agents.
We have made great strides and now have one of the more dynamic value-add distribution models in the industry, which gives us the potential to be unstoppable. Looking to 2016, we will continue to focus on enhancing the productivity of our sales distribution. The Affordable Care Act has opened up two opportunities for Aflac to feel gaps created by the high deductible health plan. First, gap in ACA coverage have allowed us to position Aflac products alongside major medical as a holistic solution. And Everwell allows our agents to take a competitive approach to offer this comprehensive solution of major medical and voluntary products to the small case markets. Therefore, we will continue to focus on recruiting carrier agents, training them and promoting the use of Everwell to support growth in this segment.
In addition, as more brokers have entered the voluntary market, we continue to deepen existing relationships with our broker partners who serve the mid to large case segment by providing tools and services to the support broken needs such as proposal management tools, improved underwriting systems and environment integration. As Dan mentioned, One Day Pay will continue to be a key differentiator for us, especially as some of the major medical payers have entered the voluntary market. Despite these new entrants, we believe One Day Pay are industry-leading claim initiative, stands out to consumers because it gives cash in the hands of those consumers when they need it the most. We will continue to promote One Day Pay to the consumer as we feel that this will help drive increased brand loyalty and account penetration.
Lastly, as the voluntary market continues to grow, with the broker channel group products growing at a faster rate, scale and efficiency will become increasingly important. Although, we have made some investments in our platform to support our broker partners, we need to make additional technology investments to support continued growth, while enhancing persistency and efficiency of the business. Looking ahead keep in mind, that as our production through brokers growth, we anticipate sales will be increasingly concentrated in the fourth quarter, more specifically, the last four weeks of the year.
In addition, this is the first full year in which the broker sales forecasting models has been in play. We continue to believe that we are on track to meet the lower end of the 3% to 7% range in U.S. and 2015, and we are assuming that all of the enrollments that are expected will proceed as planned at the end of the year. Now, as we look to 2016, we believe sales will increase in the range of 3% that 7%. The voluntary work site market is currently projected to grow at 5% over the next 3 years. And as you know, we won\xe2\x80\x99t be satisfied until we are growing at or above industry rate.
Thank you. And now, let me turn over to Fred.
Fred Crawford
Thank you, Teresa. Let me start with a few of the key areas we are focused on in terms of the financial management as we enter 2016. We continue to execute on our general account investment strategy, expanding into new asset classes and mandating external managers where we lack the expertise. In terms of core asset classes, we added middle market loans over the last year and are in the process of building out a commercial loan portfolio and we will initiate a modest investment in equities in the next few weeks. Additionally, in the coming years, we will take a measured approach to adding growth assets, which include public and private activities, hedge funds and other alterative asset classes that are both consistent with our liability structure and industry practices. This is a slow ramp up, with growth in assets expected to reach roughly $3 billion in 2017. We expect these new asset classes will add significant excess investment income in the long-term, recognizing we will incur near-term expenses during the bidding process.
In terms of risk management, we are working to reduce potential volatility in Aflac, Japan\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory solvency margin ratio or SMR, which is sensitive to interest rates, spreads and exchange rates. Reducing volatility allows for greater clarity in identifying excess capital, improves consistency in free cash flow generation and ultimately drives the lower risk profile in cost of capital. Measuring our excess capital position includes a block-by-block assessment of the regulatory reserves in Japan and associated reinsurance capacity, testing regulatory capital measures under stress conditions and comprehensive economic capital analysis. We have successfully used reinsurance in the past to unlock excess capital in Japan. We also believe excess capital exists in the U.S. when considering the stability and low risk profile of our business model.
Importantly, we do not see any change in our core principles surrounding risk and capital management. In accordance with our risk appetite, we will maintain strong SMR and RBC ratios at a minimum wage of 500% to 600%, leverage at or below 25% and hold roughly $500 million in excess capital and liquidity at the holding company at all times. Deployment priorities include supporting our dividend growth track record and a bias towards repurchasing our stock absent compelling alternatives.
Turning to Slide 17 and a discussion of assumptions underlying our 2016 earnings drivers, we expect stability in our core margins. Consistent with comments on our third quarter earnings call, we expect premium growth rates in the low single-digits supported by stable persistency and our sales outlook. Note that Japan premium is somewhat impacted by the combination of reinsurance, the effect of limited pay products reaching paid up status and steady decline in first sector sales as we further refine our strategy. I would note that while limited pay product is a headwind to premium growth, it has no impact on profitability as we release a deferred profit liability into earnings.
Net investment income primarily in Japan is expected to decline by roughly 1% to 2% in 2016 as a result of calls and maturities of private placement holdings. New money will be reinvested according to our strategic asset allocation though at lower rates due to lower market yields, but arguably will reinforce our strategy of having a more diverse and higher quality portfolio as we remain cautious on the go forward credit environment.
We expect core benefit ratios to remain stable and consistent with our generally favorable experience thus far in 2015 and relative to our forecasted long-term ranges discussed at our May Financial Analyst Briefing. In Japan, we anticipate continued strong claim strengths in our cancer block in particular. In the U.S., expense ratios are up modestly as a result of investment in overall IT, group administration and Everwell platforms.
Turning to Slide 18, we expect overall capital conditions to remain stable, but are keeping an eye on credit conditions. We have seen the early signs of a credit cycle, with spreads widening in recent months and downgrades modestly outpacing upgrades. We expect to maintain our SMR and RBC ratios in the mid to high 800% range subject to market value changes. Our SMR ratio is sensitive to rates and spreads, with a roughly 220 point volatility provision that recognizes the unrealized gains in our AFS portfolio and the potential for stress conditions. Leverage will remain in the 23% to 25% range and we expect to pre-fund approximately $1 billion of maturities prior to coming due later in the year and early in 2017.
We have revised our plans for repatriation in 2015 and now expect to repatriate an additional \xc2\xa560 billion this month, which represents the remaining capital released from our 2015 reinsurance transaction. The December repatriation and associated statutory dividends to the holding company support our $1.4 billion of targeted repurchase for 2016, front-end loading roughly $1 billion of our repurchase in the first half of the year. Note that our 2016 repatriation estimate does not currently assume any reinsurance and represents a stable repatriation of after-tax FSA earnings. We have reviewed in detail our 2016 and 3-year excess capital position and remain comfortable with a deployable capital range of 6.3 billion to 7.5 billion through 2017. The lower end of the range consistent with our organic free cash flow and the range itself representing additional deployable capital we believe is embedded in Japan and U.S. businesses.
Finally, I will close with my comments on specific EPS outlook and a few thoughts on driving long-term valuation. We expect stable growth in EPS in the 3% to 7% range, excluding the impact of currency movement. As a basis for our growth rate estimate, for 2015, we assume the midpoint of $1.36 to $1.56 EPS range for the fourth quarter and normalized for a net $0.05 of positive items called out in our earnings releases during the year. We provide specific EPS guidance in sensitivities to the yen, which remains largely consistent with our third quarter disclosures. We estimate that everyone \xc2\xa51 move on the annual average exchange rate will equal an approximately $0.025 per share impact on next year\xe2\x80\x99s earnings.
ROE is expected to remain in the 18% to 21% range, excluding the impact of currency. Our cost of capital is among the lowest in the industry benefiting from low exposure to more volatile and capital intensive equity market and interest rate sensitive retirement businesses, transparent profit margins and generating yen cash flows, which allows us to borrowing yen at very low range. In addition, we believe our work in recent years to reduce concentrated and potentially volatile exposures in the general account have also contributed. Our financial playbook for creating value is straightforward, defend attractive margins in our core supplement health businesses, in Japan allocate capital away from more volatile return and capital-intensive businesses to stable businesses that earn comfortably above our cost of capital, invest to improve service and efficiency in our fast growing U.S. brokerage and group business, manage the risk in our investment portfolio and associated SMR volatility, and finally, identify idle or excess capital for future deployment at higher rates of excess return while returning back to shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Dan for some closing comments.
Dan Amos
Thank you, Fred. I want to close with some thoughts that should be top of mind as we look to next year. Everything that you have heard today is designed around growing our franchise, protecting policyholders and ultimately driving shareholder value. In Japan and the United States, we dominate our markets and we plan to keep it that way. Aflac Japan, the leading provider of third sector products will be focused on new product innovation in the third sector market. While we expect sales of first sector products to decline in 2016, those first sector products we do sell will encourage the cross-selling of third sector products. Aflac U.S. is concentrating on leveraging our brand to fuel our growth and benefit our distribution channels, while investing to enhance customer experience and efficiencies.
To follow-up on Fred\xe2\x80\x99s comments, our goal is to achieve stable EPS growth, while also investing in the business to drive future growth. When it comes to dividend increases, we belong to an Elite club. This year marked the 33rd year of increasing our cash dividend. In addition by the end of 2015, we expect to have repurchased $1.3 billion of common stock and plan for a modest increase in 2016 absent more compelling opportunities. I want to reiterate what we said at the Financial Analyst Briefing in May. We still believe there is an opportunity to deploy approximately $6.3 billion to $7.5 billion in capital when looking at a 3-year period ending 2017. We will continue to evaluate all options when it comes to deploying capital and growing the business. But as in the past, we remain disciplined. You already heard me say that my job is to balance the interest of all stakeholders. I think we did a good job of that this year just as we did in the past. And I believe we are going to do it again next year by delivering on our promises to our policyholders and ultimately enhancing shareholder value.
Now, I will turn the program back over to Robin. Robin?
Robin Wilkey
Thank you, Dan. Now, we are ready to take your questions. But first, let me remind you that to be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up that relates to the initial question. Alright, we are ready to go. We will take the first question please.
Operator
Thank you. The first question is coming from Mr. Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. You may now ask your question.
Jimmy Bhullar
On Japan sales and I thought your guidance of sales I think you mentioned, down in the mid single-digits seemed slightly more conservative than what I would have assumed. And a bigger part of your growth in 2015 has been through the Japan Post where you continue to add new branches. So I would have thought that would have provided tailwind to sales. So maybe if Paul you could give us a few more details on what\xe2\x80\x99s behind your expectation of a mid single-digit decline?
Paul Amos
Sure Jimmy, will be glad to do that. First and foremost, if you look at 2016 in comparison to 2014, we are moving along exactly where we originally expected. The reality is that 2015 came in at significantly higher than we expected. As you recall, I think we originally had a range of between 1% and 5% for this year and moved that up on several different occasions and we now expect top end of that 10% to 13% range. And so 2015 has been a year where we feel we have outperformed our expectations. We do expect to grow long-term at 4% to 6% CAGR and we expect that to be onward and moving upward. At the same time, we also acknowledge that our product cycles have an effect and impact on our annual sales. We had back to back years where we launched our new cancer plan as well as some revisions and new riders to medical plan. This coming year, we expect there to be some product revisions, but we do expect that we can potentially enter a new segment of the third sector market anytime you go into a brand new product that can create a circumstance where you have to create that market and it can take a period of time to do so. So we feel that we are setting ourselves up for the long-term. It does mean the potential for sales being down slightly, but we still feel that we are making the right decisions for growing our sales long-term in the compound annual growth rate that we previously mentioned.
Jimmy Bhullar
Okay. And then if I could ask just one more to Fred, you mentioned that your guidance doesn\xe2\x80\x99t assume anything in terms of reinsurance deals, but what are you looking at in terms of whether you decided to do additional reinsurance deals in 2016 and if you do them what do you view as of the most likely use of the capital?
Fred Crawford
Yes. Thanks Jimmy. I think couple of things about releasing additional excess capital, particularly in Japan, where we have done it before. As you know, what we are doing there essentially is through reinsurance, we are unlocking the difference in regulatory reserves relative to Japan and U.S. and freeing up that capital. And in some cases, we retain that capital to support our SMR ratios. That\xe2\x80\x99s being done on a block by block basis as you know. So it requires assessing each block. And as you more forward and look at additional blocks, the level of complexity increases. And depending on the block of business, you may even see pricing differences, i.e. reinsurance getting more pricy. The reason I point out that complexity and some of the pricing is that it really goes to the main motivation, which is if we are going to go in and unlock additional capital we want to make sure that we can generate very attractive returns on the deployment of that capital. And so I view that exercise of unlocking excess capital over and above our free cash flow as somewhat opportunistic. We want to see good attractive excess returns now that may be in the form of buying back our stock, but maybe other opportunities and we want optionality to look at it. The key is it\xe2\x80\x99s available. It\xe2\x80\x99s available for defensive measures, it\xe2\x80\x99s available to reinvest back in our model, it\xe2\x80\x99s available to take advantage of opportunities. But the key is driving excess capital with that release.
Jimmy Bhullar
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from Randy Binner of FBR. You may now ask your question.
Randy Binner
Thanks. I was hoping to follow-up on the new third sector products commentary, is there any help you can give us on understanding what that might look like?
Paul Amos
Unfortunately Randy, we can\xe2\x80\x99t comment on that at this time. All I tell you is that, we continue to look at third sector products because of their product characteristics, strong profitability and we will be looking to enter a potential product there. But we have to work with our regulators as well as finalizing that product. And we will look to hopefully launch that sometime in 2016.
Randy Binner
Okay. And then, sticking with sales on the U.S. side, the range of 3% to 7% is pretty wide. But what would have to happen I guess for you to hit the high end the 7%, can you walk us through, what all needs to go right for that to happen in 2016?
Teresa White
2016 range, I believe I meant to say 3% to 5% \xe2\x80\x93 I meant to say 3% to 7%. But the slide deck has the appropriate number. But it\xe2\x80\x99s 3% to 5%. And the changes that we have made with the distribution and the growth that we are seeing from a broker perspective, we believe as we continue to mature, our market offices continue to mature, that we will be on track with meeting the high end of that range.
Dan Amos
Let me make a comment about U.S. sales. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think our biggest challenge is external, I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s been internal. One thing I think Teresa has done a stellar job of \xe2\x80\x93 is we have got two now separate distribution channels. You go back 4 years or 5 years ago, we really only had one and that was our field force which is very important to us and it\xe2\x80\x99s still the foundation on which everything has been built. But as we are writing the bigger accounts with the brokers, in the past there has been real conflict. And what we tried to do is to bring them together as one and use our field force in certain cases to help with the enrollments. And it\xe2\x80\x99s working out quite well. The easiest thing we could have done was to have had two separate companies, kept them totally apart. The problem was, everybody wanted the Aflac brand. So we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t separate them. Everyone wanted it. So we brought them together, which has created internal conflict over the last couple of years. It is much, much better and I give Teresa and Andy and everyone else credit for helping that come together. But it is still \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s been years of competitiveness let\xe2\x80\x99s call it. And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just go away overnight. You have to work through it as you all know. And so that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the challenges. So as we continue to make and show examples of people working together and writing big accounts, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to only open the door and then as we are driving our new associates and others to writing the 100 or less, which we have been working on for a couple of years and as we work on getting the big accounts to be written with the large brokers, through the group platform, that continues to work well. The area that\xe2\x80\x99s still the conflict is the 100 to about the 1,000 accounts. And those are the ones that we deal with. So as we work through that, I think the opportunity for future growth is tremendous. And again, I give Teresa credit for fighting that battle because it isn\xe2\x80\x99t an easy one, because they have been in a competitive environment since inception of the company. So I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s coming together. Watch out when it does, because that\xe2\x80\x99s when you will see the growth.
Randy Binner
Thanks. And then just one more on U.S. sales and sorry if I missed it, but I mean how significant is the Everwell piece of that, I mean because most of what \xe2\x80\x93 most of what you are talking about is kind of the traditional sales organization and the changes that have been made there over the last year, but is \xe2\x80\x93 would Everwell, if you are going to hit the high end of 2017 sales guide, I guess may be if that was higher, does that become more material then?
Teresa White
Absolutely, Everwell becomes very material. One of the things that we are seeing with our adoption of Everwell and especially during the pilot we see a 40% increase in penetration when people utilize Everwell. So it positions us quite nicely with the Affordable Care Act, where we have major medical and the high deductible health plans being presented along five voluntaries. So it gives the small case market something that they have not had, which is an opportunity to shop for their coverage on one exchange that allows them to see voluntary and major medical.
Randy Binner
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Jay Gelb
Thanks. Good morning. I was \xe2\x80\x93 I want to turn back to Slide 17 if we could, the key assumptions on earnings drivers, I am trying to understand the comment that, Aflac expects current benefit ratios in the U.S. and Japan to benefit from favorable claims trends, but at the same time it looks like the benefit ratio 2016 relative to 2015, this can be largely unchanged?
Dan Amos
Yes. And what we are seeing there is if you go back to FAB, the FAB meeting this year, I would call your attention to some of the long ranges or the long-term ranges that we put in for benefit ratios both in the U.S. and Japan. And what you will notice is that year-to-date in 2015 we have been tracking in a fairly material way at a favorable end of those ranges. And really what we are seeing in our 2016 projections is that relative to our year-to-date performance, we would expect to move forward with continued favorability. Now, it moves a little bit from what we are seeing year-to-date, but realize how much more favorable it is relative to our FAB guidance. So for example, our guidance on U.S. benefit ratios at FAB was 50% to 52%, we have been year-to-date tracking very low at roughly 48% and we are suggesting 47% to 49% as the range. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s really what I mean by that comment is a continuation of what we believe to be really favorable or net favorable performance in 2015.
Jay Gelb
Alright. Thanks for clarifying that. And then on the Japan Post opportunity, I guess, following up on an earlier question, I would have thought that that would have continued momentum into 2016, am I thinking about that the wrong way?
Dan Amos
Unfortunately, we cannot comment on Japan Post. I can tell you that we continue to be very happy with the relationship. We continue to succeed in not only the implementation of the 20,000 post offices, but the use of the additional product as well as the Aflac core product through the sale of that channel, along with selling to comp insurance and all three of those continue to meet or exceed our expectations. We are happy with what\xe2\x80\x99s happening there. At the same time, we can\xe2\x80\x99t give any comments on specifics or numbers related to our Japan Post relationship.
Jay Gelb
Alright, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from Eric Berg with RBC. Your line is now open.
Eric Berg
Thanks very much and good morning. In Japan that next year you have indicated that you plan to focus at least on the life insurance side if I understand your comments correctly on the level premium as opposed to the single premium. To me, this sounds like permanent life insurance and that you will be going head to head against companies whose brands in this area, then this largest carrier agent-oriented companies in the country whose brands are as strong as yours are in that corner of the market. So, my one question is twofold. One, what is Aflac\xe2\x80\x99s history in successfully selling level premiums for sector products? To what extent have you done and to what extent have you been successful? And why should we think that given the different competitive nature and the relative less strength of your brand in the first sector market and the third sector that you can be successful?
Paul Amos
This is Paul. Eric, let me say that our exclusive agencies have always been offered a well-rounded product portfolio that was of course driven first and foremost by third sector products beginning with cancer and now medical, but also with the first sector products both lump-sum and level premium. And as I have said on several calls, we have made a commitment to continue to offer those to our exclusive agencies, all forms of those products, because we believe that is what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for them to be competitive in the marketplace and part of their commitment to us by providing us the exclusivity of only offering Aflac products. What we are seeing however is that in the highly competitive bank channel and other markets when it comes to lump-sum premier products, we believe we want to significantly deemphasize those products. We are taking measures in order to continue the decline in the sale of those products, but we have seen such a high cross-sell ratio between our level premium first sector to our third sector products by our associates and other traditional channels that we believe that selling those products is not only an enhancement, because it exceeds our cost of capital, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also an enhancement because it drives the additional premium at the higher profit margin that we are achieving through the third sector sale.
Eric Berg
If I could just get one in quickly actually for Theresa and it is that I have always looked at your tally, your regularly reported tally of producing agents, because I just view that historically as an important indicator of the future of sales. Those numbers have not been going in the right direction. They have been declining in the United States for some time. As we look forward into 2016 whether you, Theresa, Dan or whoever feels appropriate answer this question, we will be the counter-producing agents be as important in terms of understanding Aflac in the future as it was in the past? And what should we expect for this sense as discounted producing agents? Thanks.
Teresa White
Eric, this is Teresa. One of the things that I have discussed in the past is how the bifurcation of the model, creating the carrier agent distribution and then separating it from the broker distribution will I think help you in doing exactly what you are attempting to do. One of the things that we have done this year is we have started to separate those and yes we will continue to drive carrier recruiting. Today, that number is a holistic number that represents carrier recruiting and brokers. And what we wanted to do is we wanted to separate those numbers and I believe in 2016 that\xe2\x80\x99s the plan and Robin is shaking her head, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s our plan for the briefing go forward. We have this year where we basically have to settle in and get everybody in the right bucket. But from there go forward, the plan is to continue career recruiting and then you heard me express from a broker perspective deepening the relationships with our current or existing brokers. We will continue to grow our broker relationships, but quite frankly, what I wanted to concentrate on in 2015 and in 2016 is deepening the relationships that we have with our current broker partners. We have a number of broker partners out there that we are not selling a lot of Aflac insurance. And I think there is tremendous opportunity there and so that\xe2\x80\x99s the plan.
Eric Berg
Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from Mr. Seth Weiss from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Seth Weiss
Hi, good morning. Thank you. I would like to follow-up on the discussion around margins. Could you clarify exactly what the dynamics are that are going to lead to again beneficial experience in 2016? And then maybe more specifically what it is you are expecting that changes in actually 2017 and beyond that causes that to come back down to the margin ranges that you gave earlier this year at FAB?
Fred Crawford
Sure, Seth, it\xe2\x80\x99s Fred. Couple of things. So in Japan, what we are seeing is really predominantly a continuation of the favorable experience we have been enjoying really in the cancer block of business. And as that continues, we would expect that to generate the lower end of the benefit ratio. And if you recall back to our third quarter discussion, you have a couple of dynamics going on there not only you have favorable claims dynamics due to hospitalization rates and other issues that are trending in Japan, but you also have to constantly review and look at your reserving dynamics as well, IBNR and the like. And so, it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for us to see quarter-to-quarter benefits from both the trends and the review of the reserves particularly year-to-year. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s really what\xe2\x80\x99s driving Japan. Otherwise, we see relative stability across the other lines of business in terms of benefit ratio, including first sector, which as you know carries naturally a higher benefit ratio and lower expense ratio.
In the U.S., it\xe2\x80\x99s really a general continuation of good performance, nothing unusual spiking out in 2016, just an overall continuation as we track that business. I think the bigger mover to pay attention to in the U.S. as it relates to margins is actually the expense ratio. As I noted in my comments, it remains a little elevated about 100 basis points or so elevated and that\xe2\x80\x99s actually predominantly due to what Theresa commented on in terms of our proactive need to invest in both IT automation, and end-to-end administration around our fast growing broker-driven group product sales. And so that is really a proactive decision on our part to \xe2\x80\x93 which adds about 80 basis points to our expense ratio, but obviously has very tight return on investment characteristics with it as we roll forward.
What I would comment on in terms of 2017 and \xe2\x80\x9818 is we will obviously refresh all of our margin views at this year\xe2\x80\x99s FAB and roll forward a 3-year look. And so yes, at the moment we are sticking with the current ranges that were discussed earlier in the year, but obviously as we grow quarter-to-quarter and year-by-year, we will continue to review those trends and whether or not we expect them to stay around longer or deteriorate or improve.
Seth Weiss
Okay. Thank you. So, is it fair to categorize those longer-term trends, that there is some conservatism built in a cushion for that?
Fred Crawford
Sure, I mean when we use the term favorable, what we are suggesting to you is that indeed they are running favorable to what we otherwise would have expected over a long run, and that is true. And we have been enjoying that in 2015. You have seen that in our results. And so as we sit here today we think we are travelling on the favorable end of benefit ratios both in Japan and in the U.S. and that should be noted. But we are going to continue to monitor that for what we think is more sustainable going forward or whether or not we would see some natural leakage. Keep in mind that when I think about these benefit ratios, these are still supporting extremely strong return on equity and return on overall IRRs on all of our voluntary supplemental health businesses.
Seth Weiss
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is coming from Mr. Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Tom Gallagher
Good morning. Fred, I wanted to discuss Japan revenues, I know you mentioned NII is expected to be down a bit and you mentioned what you expect on overall margins in Japan, how about premium revenue growth in \xe2\x80\x9816 versus \xe2\x80\x9815?
Fred Crawford
Sure. A couple of things and I will maybe add a little more color on the NII in the process too, but in terms of Japan revenue a couple of things to be mindful of. I think its natural for you to come to the table saying coming up particularly a year of very strong sales in third sector, that we would see a little more robust growth in Japan revenue. But we got a couple of things going on. One is mass, meaning with the very, very large in-force size of our business that\xe2\x80\x99s generating in and around \xc2\xa51.5 trillion a year of earned premium, when you have even the very strong persistency we enjoy or roughly say 5% lapse rates, you have got to have one whole heck of a growth engine if you will to just keep pace with the natural lapsation. For example, if you look at third sector, we would expect to see something in the rate of 5% natural runoff of lapsation and that\xe2\x80\x99s on \xc2\xa51.1 trillion earned premium book. And so that suggests you that your third sector sales engine alone needs to be doing much better than \xc2\xa555 billion or \xc2\xa560 billion of sales just to keep some growth rate going. Now, as you look more expansive and the good news is that Paul and his team have generated a very good engine. I mean if you look at that chart, if you go back a couple of years, the distribution platform was generating in and around \xc2\xa560 billion to \xc2\xa565 billion a year of new sales. That engine now, even as we look forward to 2016 is now approaching $75 billion to as high as $80 billion distribution engine and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to serve to help grow third sector premium \xe2\x80\x93 earned premium in and around the 1.5% to 2% range will be my estimate.
When you look at first sector, however you have get a couple of things going on. One, naturally you are going to see premium come down, because as Paul has outlined we are refining our approach to it, moving away on lump-sum. But the other thing you have going on is you also have some of the more limited pay product. If you recall back to this year\xe2\x80\x99s FAB meeting, we have limited pay products, when it reaches paid-up status you will see a drop-off in the premium levels. And in fact, moving from 2015 to \xe2\x80\x9816, we are seeing about \xc2\xa530 billion of drop-off just related to the paid-up status of these limited premium paid products. Now again remember, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t impact profitability, because we have a liability that we release into our earnings, which keeps profitability constant, but it does pressure premium. So when you think of the combination of reinsurance, which is now tailing off, we had reinsurance effect this year compared to next year probably around \xc2\xa55 billion or so of depressed growth related to reinsurance. If you look at that plus the first sector, plus the limited pay product now starting to reach paid-up status, all of those things are contributing to a muted premium growth rate in Japan.
Tom Gallagher
And Fred, if you just \xe2\x80\x93 following you on that math with the \xc2\xa530 billion drop-off are we getting like a point or two of the decline in premium revenue, was that directionally close?
Fred Crawford
Yes. If you just isolate first sector business which runs about \xc2\xa50.5 billion a year in earned premium that \xe2\x80\x93 just that paid-up status is contributing to roughly 1% decline year-over-year in the earned premium, that\xe2\x80\x99s for 2016.
Tom Gallagher
Got it. And you said third sector is supposed to grow 1.5% to 2%, so is it fair to say then you would still get kind of flattish to maybe modest growth overall then?
Fred Crawford
Well, as I have said in my comments, we are expecting about 1% growth in premium overall.
Tom Gallagher
1% growth. Got it. Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s helpful color. I appreciate it. And then just my follow-up is on the \xe2\x80\x93 in terms of the product shift, moving from away from lump-sum sales of first sector, can you remind us what percent of Japanese sales this year in the first sector were lump-sum versus level pay?
Fred Crawford
I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that handy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Paul if you happen to have that handy or not?
Paul Amos
We are looking forward right here. Give us just one second.
Fred Crawford
Thinking roughly a third.
Tom Gallagher
A third would have been lump-sum or a third would have level pay?
Fred Crawford
A third lump-sum.
Tom Gallagher
A third lump-sum, got it.
Teresa White
And if we need to correct that, Tom we will do that, we will look at it and verify that.
Tom Gallagher
Okay. Thank you.
Paul Amos
Really quickly, just looking at our projections is to verify, it\xe2\x80\x99s about half and half, it\xe2\x80\x99s split almost down the middle on the premium on a AP basis.
Tom Gallagher
And Paul and that roughly half of the first sector sales, is that going to zero or is that just a substantial decline, but you will still have some level of lump-sum sales?
Paul Amos
We are going to have some for a couple of different reasons Tom. First of all, as I mentioned earlier, when Eric asked we are going to continue to allow our exclusive agencies to offer a lump-sum product as they have to have it in order to be competitive, but we are going to significantly change certain rates in order to make that happen. At the same time, we also have commitments to bank channel and those commitments tend to last six months at a time, and so we will continue to see that happen during the first quarter of next year, because as you know the Japan fiscal calendar begins April 1. And so we will probably see slower tapering in the first quarter with a faster tapering beyond the first quarter.
Tom Gallagher
Okay. Thanks.
Teresa White
Nicole, we are reaching the top of the hour, so I think we have time for one last question, please?
Operator
Thank you. The last question is coming from Suneet Kamath from UBS. Your line is now open.
Suneet Kamath
Thanks. Good morning. A question on Japan sales and the long-term target of 4% to 6% for the third sector, it just seems like in recent years we have been experiencing really strong growth in a particularly year, when you had a new product introduction and then when you face comps that were difficult in the subsequent year, had less robust sales growth, so I guess my question is, as we think about this 4% to 6% long-term guidance and the shortening product cycle that the industry is experiencing, Paul do you think that we can get to a point that you are generating 4% to 6% third sector sales growth on a consistent basis?
Paul Amos
That would certainly be the ideal situation. That said, certain products are going to have a higher level of attractiveness than others. The reaction to our cancer plan exceeded all of our expectations. And we certainly want to take that premium and offer those products that exceeded our total sales number. What I would tell you is that one of the reasons we would like to enter on additional product line third sector is we would like to see our vision on an annual basis on a 3-year cycle and so if we add three core products in third sector with one product revision every year that would put a hopefully a smoother number for us in attempting to achieve that CAGR. That said, it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to predict market receptiveness. But that is the objective, as I have said part of the reason this year that we now face difficult comps, but in trying to launch a brand new product in an industry and with the sales distribution that tends to be slower to adapt new products as opposed to new product revisions, we are just trying to be mindful of that as we head into 2016 and think that we can prepare ourselves better for the longer term in achieving that CAGR.
Dan Amos
I want to say some, Suneet, this is Dan. In the old days, I would have had a contest that started in the first quarter to shift some of the business from the fourth quarter to the first quarter to try to level it out. It was a conference call that we had with all of you where everyone said, get the business when you can as quick as you can and so we shifted back to get in the business as fast and as quick as we can. And we felt like it\xe2\x80\x99s better to have the 13% now than if we ended up with 6% and 5%. So, for whatever those totals might be to sum up, but ultimately, we were just trying to get it in. So, we could have made it more leveled by shifting the context, not literally holding business, but just shifting things. So, it is our outstanding production in the fourth quarter that\xe2\x80\x99s causing our problem for 2016. And so I just want to be clear on that.
Suneet Kamath
Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s appreciated. One quick follow-up on Japan, I know you can\xe2\x80\x99t give us any specifics about Japan Post and I appreciate that. But if I go back Dan to the relationship that you had with Daiichi years ago when you first started it, my recollection is that sales growth was quite strong in that first year and then the relationship became somewhat of a drag on growth in subsequent years, because even though you are generating new business, it\xe2\x80\x99s wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite at the level of that extremely strong first year. So, I guess my question is directionally should we think that Japan Post will be any different from that situation that you experienced?
Dan Amos
Yes. And the reason you should is with Daiichi Life, we hit it all at once. It\xe2\x80\x99s been rolled out \xe2\x80\x93 and Japan Post has been rolled out by over a period of years, not just one quick shop. Will it eventually slowdown? Probably so unless we come up with something else new, innovative that we can get together with the model. But let me just say that I give our relationship with Japan Post from what I thought it would be, to where it is today and that\xe2\x80\x99s all I can say about that. But I think Aflac Japan and the leadership that Paul, Yamaguchi, the sales force all the people get an A on what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on. And our relationship is stronger today with Japan Post than it has ever been and I look for it continued to be strong, because it\xe2\x80\x99s helping not only us, but it\xe2\x80\x99s helping Japan Post and it\xe2\x80\x99s helping the policyholders in Japan.
Suneet Kamath
Alright. Thanks, Dan.
Dan Amos
Okay.
