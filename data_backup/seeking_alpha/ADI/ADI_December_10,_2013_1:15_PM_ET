Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
Welcome everybody and welcome back after lunch. And thanks, welcome here to the ADI folks. We have Dave Zinsner, CFO; Ali Husain, IR. So before we go into the -- this is supposed to be a fireside Q&A and we\xe2\x80\x99ll then open it up to questions for the audience. But before we do that Dave, if you could just walk us, give us a quick overview of the ADI story for those who may not be familiar with the company.
Dave Zinsner
So I\xe2\x80\x99m actually -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Ali do the elevated pitch, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll kind of tag team on the questions. So, Ali why don\xe2\x80\x99t you?
Ali Husain
All right. Hi everyone. Thanks Ambrish for having us at BMO as well. So I see a lot of faces here, some new, some that I know. But in any event thank you for being here. So, the analog piece of the semiconductor market is about $30 billion and ADI is about 10% of that market. And really when you kind of split that market out, you have two pieces; one being power management whereas that area where most of our competitors play, the other piece being the signal path or where ADI plays. And really the fundamental building blocks of the signal paths are converters and what we call the high performance amplifiers. And both these sort of product areas, are areas where ADI derives over two thirds of our revenue and where we are also the market leader and are gaining share.
So it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit of a unique story with ADI within analog, so not only we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing -- we\xe2\x80\x99re doing a bit of power management, we\'re really we\xe2\x80\x99re focusing much more or serve on the signal path. But where we are focusing is in areas where basically we have the number one market share position and where we\xe2\x80\x99re gaining share. At ADI most of our products are very sort of long life cycled products. There is very low capital intensity. None of our customers -- but you know we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a single customer that\xe2\x80\x99s greater than 5% of sales. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very sort of diversified kind of customer base, not only on the customer side but across regions and markets as well. 
What this all allows us to do is basically generate a lot of cash and what we try to then do is take that cash and return it to our shareholders. So, just a couple of quarter ago we put into place this plan of returning 80% of our generated free cash flow to our shareholders over the next five years. And we\xe2\x80\x99re early stages yet of that plan, but certainly it\xe2\x80\x99s a commitment over the five years, over the next five years we\xe2\x80\x99ll be returning 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders.
And just quickly just level set in terms of how our end market split works out, but half of our sales come from the industrial end market, but 20% or so comes from the automotive end market and that\xe2\x80\x99s been growing very well for us. Another about 20% comes from the communications infrastructure end market, primarily in the wireless side where the radios basically that go on base stations. And then about another 14% or 15% depending on the quarter comes from the consumer end market.
So that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of ADI in an about a 30 second elevated pitch I think, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll just turn it back over to you Ambrish for questions.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
Okay, thank you very much. So, you guys have been very transparent about consumer, we had been through this. At the last earnings call there were a lot -- not a lot, there were few questions around market share loss in industrial communications. And I was trying to -- Ali I went back and tried to do it and it\'s so hard to do because you can\xe2\x80\x99t do an apples-to-apples comparison. People count their industrial businesses differently, they count their communication differently. But at a high level if you just look at industrial -- if we look at total analog versus ADI, and we understand there you have, as I said before you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the consumer. But what is the right way to think about market share in the hard to count market such as industrial and communications?
Dave Zinsner
Well, let me take a little like kind of side position on this. If you look at kind of the -- Ali talked about the kind of major building blocks of products we sell. Two thirds of our revenue comes either from data converters or high performance amps. In both of those, you can look at IDE supply and data bins and data quests, whatever as you want to. In both cases our share has actually increased over the last four or five years. So, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty confident, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t lost share. In fact actually we\xe2\x80\x99ve been gaining share.
There has been -- it does look like power management might have grown a little bit faster if you look at it over kind of an extended period of time. So that might present some anomalies or relative outperformance. But, I think most of it is actually a combination of -- there is a lot of different pieces defined as an industrial in different companies. And so I think in a lot of cases we for example throw in defense but we don\xe2\x80\x99t throw in automotive, which is one of the fastest growing sub-markets and some people throw in automotive, of course that would make our industrial business grow pretty fast.
We have revenue recognition differences. We recognize revenue only when it shifts through to the end customer with regard to distributors. And in most cases companies they use a hybrid or they recognize all their revenue shift into distribution, so that kind of talk with some anomalies data.
I think looking at a quarter-to-quarter, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible to really reconcile and we can\'t even reconcile, even when I\'m looking at it to try to make sure everything makes sense from what I see, I can\xe2\x80\x99t even be sure of what I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at because of so much difference in the data. I think you got to look at it over kind of a longer period of time. And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just still happens, this happens to be a -- as you kind of -- as you look at us in this quarter this happens to be a weaker quarter. We have Thanksgiving period, we have Christmas, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to Lunar New Year in our quarter which unusual for our first quarter. So that\xe2\x80\x99s just a lot of like seasonal weakness that makes this quarter kind of have a bad compare.
But, if history is any guide and given the fact that Lunar New Year is really in the first quarter this time around, you totally expect a pretty descent second quarter. And so I guess the way I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say it is, come back to me at the end of 2014 and let\xe2\x80\x99s see where everything kind of shakes out. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that we -- as a percentage of total analog, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have at least maintained our level, if not grown our percentage of that pie over that period.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
So there was a lot of angst among my fellow sell-siders on the guidance. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve said on the call that we were surprised -- you\'re guidance is actually in line with the seasonal patterns. So where was the disconnect, was there a consumer ramp that for some reason people misconstrued what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen?
David Zinsner
Well, I think part of it was they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the Lunar New Year aspect of things. I mean we lose anywhere from 2 to 4 percentage points off of our quarter when we have Lunar New Year within that quarter. So again you strip, let\xe2\x80\x99s take the midpoint of that say three points. The midpoint of our guidance was 7.5, that kind of takes it to 4.5. You take another point, Microphone was obviously not in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s -- the idea we\xe2\x80\x99d sell it was not faked into anybody\xe2\x80\x99s numbers and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a point of headwind that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have going into the quarter.
So I think you put that in as well. And you\xe2\x80\x99re basically at kind of the consensus of most of the other peers down say 3.5%. So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s partly just you had to know the dynamics of that seasonal softness of Lunar New Year combined with the fact that we lost the Microphone because we sold it for $100 million. And I think that was most of the disconnect. I do think that there has been this, from our perspective, from investors\xe2\x80\x99 perspective, from the research analysts\xe2\x80\x99 perspective, this believes that eventually this thing has got to turn. I can\xe2\x80\x99t be soft forever, right?
And so what\xe2\x80\x99s happening I think with the models is they have this one quarter, two quarters out, this is like inflection because they figure oh my god it\xe2\x80\x99s been too long it has to happen. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen. I mean I know it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen, it\xe2\x80\x99s just the question of really when. And it\'s just timing of everything and the analysts expected it at a time in which that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to happen given the seasonal softness that we see. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens for the rest of 2014.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
I think we\xe2\x80\x99re all wrong on trying to predict when things return. So let\xe2\x80\x99s just forget the near term now, just transition on to the more longer term and I think on the earnings call you guys were pretty on a cubicle come down and saying we see a trajectory back to 6% to 8% kind of growth. And my question is, does that mean that the headwinds from any consumer divestiture that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking, that\xe2\x80\x99s behind us, and we\xe2\x80\x99re stabilizing the consumer side? And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you are confident and kind of not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to pin use 2014, but just longer term what\xe2\x80\x99s the right way to think about ADI\xe2\x80\x99s business?
David Zinsner
I think what we believe is that over the last call it three -- at least three years, maybe as much as five years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a kind of a conscious shift of investment away from some of the consumer oriented market and into areas like industrial comp infrastructure, automotive, which has already seen some growth. When you make a shift away from consumer, three days later you feel the impact. I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s really fast the way businesses, I\'m exaggerating slightly, but it\xe2\x80\x99s really quickly the fast the way the investments kind of move away or the attention rather from your customers moves away from you. So you feel, you experience that very quickly and that\xe2\x80\x99s why happened in the consumer business. We had kind of a pretty meaningful compression of that business over the last five years.
Conversely, when you make investments into industrial and com infrastructure and you double down in those areas, it takes a long time for those things to manifest itself into revenue. And sometimes it can be seven years before you actually see revenue of the design let alone to development effort. So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of what we experience is the slight pocket of revenue kind of going away in consumer and the results of the investments near the market just has not picked up yet.
We do believe that 2014 looks like a pretty descent year for a pick up. Although having said that I think the out year is beyond that \'15, \'16, \'17 have even a better opportunity for traction, particularly in areas like the industrial area. Automotive will probably already experienced some and of course com will do what it does. So, I think that gives us some confidence. We have a lot of analytics and we\xe2\x80\x99re no short of analytics at ADI, so we have a good sense I think of our design pipeline, how that\xe2\x80\x99s likely to manifest itself into revenue and a good sense of where we\'re headed in terms of business.
Now, of course all of this predicated on reasonable microenvironment and quite honestly we would have been helped out that a lot if things weren\xe2\x80\x99t choppy on the macro side over the last few years. Hopefully, things are stabilizing now, the uncertainty in the world is starting to go away. When uncertainty goes away, yields of the world start to put some money into investment, they upgrade factories, they try to get the next level of technology and that\xe2\x80\x99s really what we need for that to happen in order for our business to have some meaningful growth. We certainly have --- I could tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99re heavily incentivized to hit that 8% number. My variable compensation was a high amount, my compensation is based on getting that 8% number. So I think the company is firmly engaged on the efforts that are required to make that happen.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
So just zooming back onto the overall analog industry and it\xe2\x80\x99s not you, everybody has suffered that as you started out by saying, we\'ve all been thinking that there will be eventual get back to some kind of normalized growth. One would think that if you look at the industry guys like you Maxim, Linear, TI have strong balance sheets, franchised business. And then it almost seems like there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had not, it seems to be a diverse big dichotomy in the guys who don\xe2\x80\x99t have it, they\xe2\x80\x99re falling behind. There was a time a few years ago we used to think about, oh my good look at all the Asian analog companies they\xe2\x80\x99re going to take share, right? It happened in pockets, so we need to think what are the challenges that you would think that, bigger stronger companies should have a longer and a more stronger pipeline?
Dave Zinsner
Well, I think the biggest key -- I went with Vince around, we visited customers in Europe and we did a few in North America as well. And what is clear to me, I thought it was a little bit of lip service actually when the guys originally would talk about this, but having heard it directly from the customers, I have a real appreciation for it and that is the customers more and more are scaling down their hardware design efforts and pushing more of their dollars into software. And as they do that, they now rely on the semiconductor providers to do more of the hardware design. Before they could take data convertor and the amp out of the catalog and coupled those together and add some power management and so forth and boom they had their board. They just don\xe2\x80\x99t have the people to do that anymore. They got to work on the software problems that they face. 
So, now more and more they\xe2\x80\x99re pushing that effort off to players like Analog Devices, and you got to have a pretty good level of portfolio, pretty significant amount of portfolio enable to do those, to be able to do those system level designs. You need to know the data conversion. You need to know the amplifier and you need to have sensor products. And that the companies that at a certain levels don\xe2\x80\x99t have that scale, I think are faced with a pretty difficult challenge which didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist before. You could kind of come up with a product and get it into the end market and have pretty good traction at least on end market, that just isn\xe2\x80\x99t the way the world is moving.
So, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s our advantage. One thing which Ali mentioned at the beginning was, we start with signal processing that\xe2\x80\x99s really are the core DNA of ADI. I think most of the companies that you mentioned really have a bias towards power management. So for us if there is an advantage in that, most of the problems that initially have to be solved, have to be solved around, okay we need to capture something and we need to condition it and convert it and send it off to a processor -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not in the DNA of a power company. And so it gives us kind of a very early read into kind of the system design of these businesses. And so we can augment a lot of our core positions and data with some of our other products and kind of build that into the system as well and sell those. And I think that\'s really our opportunity.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
If you look at your core businesses where you are investing industrial and auto, I think a few years ago you highlighted automotive and shown the growth in that segment and you are bringing up industrial now and its so many different little segments going to it. But what are some of the higher, bigger applications or end markets that are driving this confidence?
Dave Zinsner
So one the businesses in this end market is the healthcare business. And it\'s actually been a business that hasn\'t grown significantly. We separately manage it as a company internally much like we did with automotive, but we saw a kind of the early reads about how automotive was going. I think it was 8% of sales when I initially broke it out, and now it\'s 20%. So it\xe2\x80\x99s ramped significantly since then. Healthcare we weren\'t quite there yet. We didn\'t quite think we had something that really justified that kind of breakout. But I think I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to see the beginnings of it. We have won some significant designs. We\'re talking hundreds of millions of dollars of design in the healthcare space. The trick with healthcare is the cycle to revenue takes a while, not only because the applications take a while to get to market but then it goes -- usually it has to go through some approval process in the various countries it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be sold into and that takes a whole series of reviews and so forth.
And so when it will happen, it\'s difficult to say but I think we have a pretty good line of sight and we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing some fairly meaningful ramp in that healthcare business. Some of the other ones that probably are a little bit farther along, a little bit mature, we sell a lot of products into energy management, both at the power meter and in the smart grid itself. Energy efficiency, always they\xe2\x80\x99ve been a huge macro trend out there and we are certainly benefiting from that. We also make signal processing that helps kind of manage mortar control and make them more power efficient. So that\'s obviously gotten a lot of traction as well in that space. What am I missing, Ali?
Just overall I would say this move in factory, it\'s towards kind of more automated factory systems. We sell a lot of silicon into robotics. And so I think that that\'s a good opportunity, but quite honestly it is a lot of little wins. There is not a ton of real home runs in the industrial space, it\'s a ton of singles and doubles and it\xe2\x80\x99s the aggregation of all of those that really kind of drives the growth. I would tell you that as we shifted, I think I want to say somewhere in the neighborhood of 20%, 25% of R&D used to be invested in the consumer space. We have scaled that down quite a bit.
A lot of the R&D resources went over into the industrial space to just continue to refine, build out, even more systems oriented products to go into the industrial space, that hopefully get great traction across hundreds and thousands of customers and kind of the incremental steps of doing that that really drives the growth.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
So sounds like if I was a samurai that -- if I go back a few years you laid out auto and you start breaking it out and then we saw the result of that, it was like medical seems to be an area that...
Dave Zinsner
I think that\'s probably a good opportunity, but I think the opportunity in the overall industrial space is quite good for us.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
Just in terms of the other segment that you guys also had a webcast on mems, what\xe2\x80\x99s the right way to think competition wise, as to micro and then related to that, what is it due to the margin profile if management [ph] starts to grow.
Dave Zinsner
So mems for us, up until the last quarter was a combination of motion sensing products and microphone products. The microphone business looked like it was getting to a point where it didn\'t really make a lot of sense for ADI to own that business. So we sold it to InvenSense and I think they will do a better job at driving it into the consumer space and that\xe2\x80\x99s really where they want to play. So it works out well for them.
So now we\xe2\x80\x99re just concentrated in the motion side. We also focus that business away from consumers, with generally in automotive and investor applications, increasingly more industrial applications are using mems products to get sense of relative motion. We\xe2\x80\x99re putting, we\xe2\x80\x99re actually launching [ph] drilling equipment, even going into the energy systems, identify tremors, so that it can be helpful in certain cases. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s got a wide range of uses.
As you point out the margins in that business today are below the corporate average, mostly as a result of just a couple of products that get sold into the automotive space and what\xe2\x80\x99s hampered the gross margins of automotive mems has been more to do with the cost of manufacturing than it has to do with kind of pricing and AFPs. In fact it gets great revenue per wafer, [indiscernible] way for kind of manufacturing [indiscernible], the revenue per wafer, because it is really, really good. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of getting the cost right. And as you bring out kind of newer technology, sometimes you got to get the [indiscernible] out of it and in this case, because of the quality standards in the automotive space and we were just trying to get products out that basically meet the function, that marriage wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite there and the cost is quite a bit higher than it should be.
We redesigned those products. We have new products down in the marketplace. It will take some time for those new products to cannibalize the old. But when that happens, the margins are going to be great in mems. And so, if it grows, fantastic, good for us, good for margins, good for profits.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
So, there is nothing structurally that keeps the margins lower?
Dave Zinsner
No. 
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
Switching over from profits to shareholder return. You guys are right at the top in terms of your reputation and correctly so in terms watching out for the shareholder capital. If you look at what you guys are committed to, 80%, this year you started out low on the buyback and I think you accelerated that. What\xe2\x80\x99s the right way to think about the mix between, A, what\xe2\x80\x99s the right way to think about mix between buyback and dividend, and then secondly I get this question a lot, Ali, when you and I were on the MBR trade after that I was getting -- what are the metrics that ADI uses buyback stock?
Dave Zinsner
Yes, okay. So, I would say in general, you could expect that probably at least two thirds of -- maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s closer even to three quarters of the cash flow return comes in the form of a dividend. We pay a good strong dividend. We\xe2\x80\x99re generally are paying out in the 60s as a percent of free cash flow for the dividend. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be our primary mechanism to get cash back to shareholders and it\xe2\x80\x99s a commitment and I think we found that when you pay out in that kind of level, payout ratio basis, it\xe2\x80\x99s generally rewarded in your stock.
And then the additional, to get to the 80% is obviously the buyback and as you point out, probably under tuned it I guess the buyback, we built a buyback structure that take advantage of volatility in the stock and when the stock kind of dips in kind of periods of, it\xe2\x80\x99s buyback stock and then when it goes above kind of these moving average as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, it just so happens that kind of the volatility that we saw in the past was a little bit smoother than we have historically -- smoother over the last year or so than it has historically been and that\xe2\x80\x99s the algorithm we kind of set up to do the buyback. We just never really executed significantly.
So what I did was I tuned it up a little bit more, so that it took less volatility for the buybacks to trigger and I did that at the beginning of October and it worked out perfectly, because we bought back $46 million worth of stock in that month but I think I pointed out that that was one month of buyback. So, now it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be tuned to that level going forward and so I would expect that month to be at decent representation of stock buybacks we should see, unless of course the stock really runs up, we shall be perfectly happy seeing, and then of course we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, but and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out a different way to do it.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
I don\xe2\x80\x99t think shareholders [indiscernible]. 
Dave Zinsner
But we are committed to the 80% and I recognize that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been under that 80% for a few quarters and that it banked, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been banked. So, I would expect that there will quarters, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when they\xe2\x80\x99ll come, but there will be quarters that we will payback more than 80%, so that the average stays at the 80% level.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
One more from me and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll open it up to the audience. On the operating model, you guys have a good job on the margin front, versus where you were in the last, and if you look at same utilization, your margins are higher. As consumer becomes smaller what\'s the right way to think about what should be the potential for margins gross operating.
Dave Zinsner
Yes. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit tied more to utilization I think, which obviously does tie to revenue to some extent, but I mean we\xe2\x80\x99re running right now, this quarter we will run in the low 60s as a percent of utilization, and we\'ll do roughly 64.5 plus or minus 50 basis points on a gross margin side. And this is what I would consider a kind of a trough kind of thing. We\'ve got our inventory now in perfect condition, it\'s at an hundred and -- I think there\'s 111 days last quarter. So it was kind of within our model.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
Please remind us where the trough was before.
Dave Zinsner
Gross margin, so the last, depends on what you call a trough, but last year first quarter, I think we were 62.8 or something like that.
Ali Husain
Yes, 62.3.
Dave Zinsner
So the trough is moving up. I would expect as business improves. we will be loading that fab higher. For every 10 percentage point move increase in utilization, we get about a 100 basis point improvement in gross margins, just from utilization on the front end, and we even get some benefit on the back end because we had to cap a test facility so that would also improve gross margin. So there\'s a pretty decent tail wind of gross margins that are up drafted, that will current gross margins as business kind of improves.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
Let\'s see if there are any questions in the audience.
Unidentified analyst
What\xe2\x80\x99s your view in terms of the right level of cash that you want to hold? I believe you hold about 30% of your market cap in cash, and I know you have a good dividend program but do you feel that you need that much cash and a related question is how do you feel about the fragmentation within the industry? Do you think you\'d be stronger if there was more consolidation among the larger players?
Dave Zinsner
So we have roughly $3.8 billion net in cash. We obviously don\'t need $3.8 billion in cash. I think over time that will get deployed. Probably a lot of it will get deployed in some form of return to shareholders. It\'s a hung up a little bit right now, because there is some expectation that eventually Washington will realize the logic of cash repatriation and allow that cash to come back at a reasonable rate, and we\xe2\x80\x99re kind of waiting for that to happen. If it doesn\'t happen which is possibly what might transpire, then we\'ll figure out another way of tapping into that cash to being the cash level down.
As far as -- some cash obviously will be used for M&A. I would say we\xe2\x80\x99re not a big acquisitor of companies, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that to change. So we\'ll some cash to do M&A but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\'s, certainly not $3.8 billion. As far as consolidation goes, I think -- the thing about Analog is, it\'s not an industry where you get a lot of benefits from scale and so I think that\'s what always kind of held up that business from having that much consolidation because it\'s hard to realize the benefits and a premium which is what\xe2\x80\x99s required, reasonable premium, which is what\xe2\x80\x99s required to get the company to give up their independent strategies and align themselves with bigger companies. We have seen some consolidation clearly and TI signed quite a bit of consolidation on their own, but I think it\'s biased towards different approaches than it is about, kind of rolling up the market.
For Analog, what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do when we do acquisitions, we generally look for technologies and we look for technologies that we\'re going to need within our chosen end markets that are going to be acquired down the road or within the near term that we just can\xe2\x80\x99t figure out a way or we don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is a great ROI to kind of do that internally, and that\'s going to be the reason we do M&A. That might create some consolidation because there might some companies out there that might fit within that model but it\xe2\x80\x99s for a different purpose than lots of wafers going through fabs, because it\xe2\x80\x99s just, the fabs only account that much anyway. I mean we talk about this updraft we get, this benefit we get in terms of absorption but really it\xe2\x80\x99s not that big. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t like oh my god, this is going to really change the world. So having 10,000 more wafers running through your fab just doesn\'t really move the needle enough to make a decision based on that.
