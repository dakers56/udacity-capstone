Q - Unidentified Analyst
Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go ahead and get started I see the clock is counting backwards just means we should get started. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to welcome everyone to the session this afternoon. It\xe2\x80\x99s my pleasure to introduce to my immediate left David Zinsner who is the CFO of Analog Devices. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to go through a fireside chat over the next 20 to 25 minutes. If you have any questions please raise your hands we have mics that are floating around the room and we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to make this is as interactive as possible.
Dave as the typical in a fireside chat format is kind of the obligatory first question in case there are any new investors in the room. As maybe you can spend the first couple of minutes just kind of positioning ADI what\xe2\x80\x99s the core IP what end markets do you address and kind of what\xe2\x80\x99s the core philosophy of the company.
David Zinsner
Yes, sure. So ADI we\xe2\x80\x99ve been around we\xe2\x80\x99re actually celebrating our 50
We virtually touch every end market that utilizes electronics and hardware in some way, our biggest end market is industrial it\xe2\x80\x99s about 50% of our business if this is a long tail of customers we probably have almost 100,000 customers in the industrial space not one of them makes up a significant portion of the revenue within industrial. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a highly fragmented business. And then we have three other end markets to make up the other half that are roughly you know depending on the year in the quarter or closely around the same percentages which are automotive, consumer and communications.
Communications for us is actually the communication infrastructure, portion of communications and we participate both in the wireless communications, base stations and so forth and on the Wireline side in terms of Fiber Optics. In consumer, we have a number of different submarkets within the consumer space but our largest one and the one that\xe2\x80\x99s driven a lot of growth recently is the portable space, but we have a lot of you know we\xe2\x80\x99re in cameras, we\xe2\x80\x99re in kind of prosumer type applications like [indiscernible] for example or high-end audio systems, broadcast systems things like that.
And then lastly we have an automotive business and we focus in three markets in automotive, infotainment, safety and powertrain and all three of those markets are kind of growth areas for us and while it\xe2\x80\x99s been actually over the course of the last five years one of our fastest-growing end markets. We are very profitable our margins are in the kind of mid-60s level. Our operating margins are in the mid-30s and the beauty of the market that we participate in relative to a lot of the semiconductor markets, it\xe2\x80\x99s the very low capital intensive market our business. So we spend about 3%, 4% of our revenue in terms of CapEx.
So at the end of the day what this business does it generates a lot of cash flow - lot of free cash flow regenerate anywhere between high-20s to low-30s as a percent of revenue in terms of free cash flow and what we do as we use little bit of that to do periodic acquisitions and then we give the rest of it back in the form of either a dividend or a buyback and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been what I would say is a relatively high dividend payer relative to the industry we\'ve grown our dividend 12 times in the last 11 years and then on the buyback side we kind - we are kind in and out depending on whether the mark - the stock is kind of moving weaker or strengthening and just kind of periodically buyback stock when it makes sense.
Unidentified Analyst
Dave when we talk a little bit about the core IP, because - a lot of Analog companies out there, but vast majority focusing on power, you guys kind of unique real estate in the semi-market given your position in A to D converters. What makes that it\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult sort of application to do well, what\xe2\x80\x99s you share in that market and kind of how big and wider the modes in your opinion?
David Zinsner
Yes, well I actually think Analog in general is really hard to do, so you know they are parts of the market that weren\xe2\x80\x99t particularly strong in that we have a tough time getting into because Analog is different than digital and that it takes a long time for the engineering teams as they come in kind of new college grads to get ramped up to a level where they really are performing at a high level and kind of can innovate.
And on top of that it\xe2\x80\x99s very much a building block kind of approach, you start out with kind of base technology and you build on that and not having done those first layers makes it impossible to jump to like the fifth layer to be able to provide a solution. So it\xe2\x80\x99s the fact that you are in it for a long time that you build up these teams over a long time that they\'ve been doing it for a long time that allows you to be able to be successful in this business.
And then also a lot of the businesses have these long lifecycle so and it takes a long time from the time you get the design to the time you actually even see revenue, so it\xe2\x80\x99s got a long payback period. So a lot of companies don\'t try it, don\'t enter this market because by the time they ever saw a return on their investment they would be bankrupt and so that kind of inhibits people from getting into this. And then as you just kind of build up more and more capabilities over time that enables you to make the solutions more elegant, higher performance, more innovative and without that kind of base understanding and be very difficult.
Where we try to hit a beachhead in Analog is in data conversion as you mentioned depending on which market study you look at where anywhere from kind of mid-40s to 50% of the market in terms of data converters. That\xe2\x80\x99s the area we focused on from the early days of when we had semiconductor business.
And I think intuitively maybe a lot of people or kind of when digital really came about really focused on digital and I think the people well before me at Analog recognized that hey everybody is going to need some ability to take real-world signals and convert them so these digital systems work, everyone is going to need a data converter so we should continue to invest in that and it was a brilliant move because that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what happened.
It\'s hard to do a lot of these data converters either have to operate at very high speeds, have to have unbelievable precision, have to be very low power in terms of usage, lower power intensity have to work in noisy environments, extreme environments where temperature is an issue and all that takes a lot of understanding about the nuances that how data conversion works and we\xe2\x80\x99ve just built up that expertise, which has enabled us to not only drive a lot of barriers to entry, but also get a good return on our investment for those products.
Unidentified Analyst
Dave, over the last sort of three plus quarters your end market exposures changed pretty dramatically relative to the outsize growth, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the consumer market which is going from around 10% and now almost 25% of total revenue on the back of the Force Touch application and your success with sort of the single customer, which is a little bit different thing kind of the rest to your business model diversified customer base, clearly there\xe2\x80\x99s been some angst that that\'s created with the investment community, can you talk a little bit about your decision to go after that application, why you think it\xe2\x80\x99s sticky sustainable, why you like that revenue stream?
David Zinsner
Okay. So we\xe2\x80\x99ve really - I would love to say that we have the whole planned idea, okay we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have this much at this customer and this much at the next customer it can\xe2\x80\x99t be orchestrated prior to that level. What we focus on is innovation, we go after innovative technology wherever that is and there is a core set of customers and this is one of the customers and they have been a large customer of ours for a long time.
We go after those customers and try to find the pockets of really, really difficult things to solve that require a lots of innovation and those are the areas we focus on and of course I would say in general that kind of distributes itself over a wide set of customers and really doesn\'t put us in a place where we\xe2\x80\x99re concentrated with anyone customer in this particular situation given the level of or where the technology was going, positioned it to where it drove a little bit more revenue at a bigger customer.
We will follow innovation anywhere it goes, if toaster ovens decided to - they decided to make a toaster oven innovative and we would go after the toaster oven market. But this just happens to be the market where a lot of innovation is happening and we were able to identify some good opportunities and that drove a lot of growth and we are pleased with it quite honestly. I would say we have - we are working hand in glove with this particular customer not only in this technology and the future generations of this technology, but also on other things that this customer wants to do with this application and other applications in the future.
And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a very strong relationship, it\xe2\x80\x99s a relationship that goes all the way up to our CEO and up to high levels within that organization. And so I think that this is a very stable business, the business we should won as the business that generates good cash flow and good return for our shareholders and so I am kind hopefully over time the success that we had here with this particular OEM.
We will be able to replicate in some other OEMs in some other markets that will be equally as impressive and drive equally and equivalent level of growth and so over time what seems like relatively high concentration at least for us which is probably not very high concentration for most companies, we will start to normalize down to a level that gets under the thresholds of 10% and going to be talking about this broadly.
Unidentified Analyst
Dave I think one of the concerns I am sure you heard this question voice is the idea that away from you the module for Force Touch has had some yield issues and we\xe2\x80\x99ve all been trying to look at your consumer revenue over the last three or four quarters and back into a unit shipment number and try to understand whether your over shipping or under shipping kind of the publicly available numbers for your customer.
I think the flaw on that analysis as we ought to make an assumption on ASP and you are not really helping us out there and I get that, but in lieu of that can you help us get more comfortable with where you think you are in the inventory situation, the yield situation with that customer. Have you been over shipping, was your guidance for the January quarter catch up so that by the end of January you think it will be more shipping closer to demand or have you think - or do you think even shipping closer to demand all the way through?
David Zinsner
Yes, well I think clearly this is true probably for any product you\xe2\x80\x99re shipping a certain unit volume by the time it goes through all the supply chain steps along the way to the end consumption there\'s always losses. I don\'t pretend to know exactly what this customer experiences along that supply chain, but I\'m going to guess that it is below what we are shipping. So there is certainly a little bit of a disconnect there and that probably means that when you look at the end customers end demand we are going to having shipping at a higher unit volume than that.
The other thing I\xe2\x80\x99d point out is that when you look at the ramp and I think this is true in a lot of the consumer customers. They tend to ramp up in advance of the launch just because nearly one have a lot of inventory ready to go for when the demand happens and they always have this kind of trajectory that says okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to kind of ramp up in it, it ramps down in the first quarter sequentially and then fix back up in the - maybe it levels off in the second quarter and fix back up in the fourth quarter.
And I think the way this trajectory is going is the way and we\xe2\x80\x99ve doubled this customer and customer in the path is exactly the way it always goes, but there is consumer and customers so it\xe2\x80\x99s not abnormal, it\xe2\x80\x99s no different than anything we would\'ve expected, obviously you have the challenge of how successful their product is you got to kind of read the [indiscernible] and watch their forecast to us and modulate the supply chain based on what you\'re seeing, but it\'s looking pretty much exactly as we had anticipated going into it now.
We were obviously cautious and partly why the guidance was a little bit more cautious because we aren\xe2\x80\x99t sure a couple weeks of orders shifting from one quarter to the next, it would be meaningful in this case and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to provide a range that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an achievable range and so we had start that a little bit there, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much as expected.
Unidentified Analyst
And then Dave I know you are not going to give us specifics around ASPs, but just hypothetically speaking does your content scale with screen size as you think about watch versus phone the smaller phone - form factor phone versus the larger form factor phone and if this application proliferates into other products, we expected to be some sort of linear scaling to screen size on the Force Touch application?
David Zinsner
I think I don\'t know the answer to that. I suspect that different screen sizes would require different solutions, I don\'t know whether that means to multiple chips so that the same chip with a different algorithm or different architecture I don\'t really know that. I would I guess we are just hopeful that as this technology proliferates at this customer and seeing benefit from it in some capacity as they rollout further.
Unidentified Analyst
I think one of the other thing that\'s kind of hurt the perception that you big\xe2\x80\x93 of customer concentration is at the time of this customers been ramping, some of your other business has been somewhat cyclically depressed. Can you talk a little bit about just the broader macro read around your industrial, auto and infrastructure business?
David Zinsner
Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. Clear - let\xe2\x80\x99s start with industrial. Industrial I\xe2\x80\x99d say in the second and rather than third and fourth quarter has been a little bit weaker. It\'s you know and not surprising because I think a lot of the guys that supply on a broad line basis and the industrial market have seen weakness. The advantage actually - we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually done a little bit better I think and that\xe2\x80\x99s because our aerospace and defense business is really carry the load there for the last couple of quarters and a lot of it\xe2\x80\x99s due to the acquisition of Hittite.
So, Hittite came to us exactly at the right time when it comes to industrial, because it really did help kind of manage the volatility in the industrial business. I would say at this point industrials kind of stabilized and the guidance that we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided for the first quarter was really kind of normal seasonality and you know really when you look at the third and fourth quarter it was within the seasonality range, but it was on a weaker side of seasonality.
So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a positive and we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to our main distributors and some of our big industrial OEMs. We get the feeling that we will see growth there it might not be a huge growth but we kind of track along GDP lines and I think that\'s what they\'re expecting and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll kind of track along with them.
In the automotive business that business was kind of hung in there in the fourth quarter it is also expected to be down sequentially kind of mid-single digits, but again that\'s pretty seasonal for us and I think that business is in pretty healthy shape despite you know kind of I get data points out there that would suggest maybe it would be a little weaker, it looks fine to us.
And then the real wildcard in our business ironically has been the communications business that business have been up over $200 million a few quarters ago and as China kind of stalled out as they go through this investigation of fraud and then really in North America things have kind of softened a bit for one reason or another we saw kind of a pretty rapid decline partly declining because demand declining and partly declining because now everyone suddenly had inventory they didn\'t need and have to kind of work that down.
It look like a trough that about 140 million in the third quarter it bounce backed up in the fourth quarter about 160 million kind of range. And I think we think it\'s going to be roughly in that at that level in the first quarter, which is actually above seasonal. So it\xe2\x80\x99s good.
So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s for covering a little bit I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s anywhere near the recovery level we want to see that and that\xe2\x80\x99s one that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of TBD it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear to us exactly when it turns on its all we get is from the customers we talk to which are the larger OEMs that supply into that wireless infrastructure space that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to turn on and it\'s just a matter of we\xe2\x80\x99re all just waiting to [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst
Dave, you mentioned earlier Hittite which was an acquisition you guys did about a year and a half ago or longer than that?
David Zinsner
Yes, in 2014.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes, so great acquisition, great asset I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s subscale, but you clearly have a bigger footprint than they do, are you starting to see revenue synergies there or is that something that\xe2\x80\x99s still on the com because it\xe2\x80\x99s just a long design cycle and if it\xe2\x80\x99s the latter help us understand how we should expect the growth rates in Hittite to start to look as that you can leverage that IP through your footprint.
David Zinsner
Yes, I tell you that that business has done great for us, it was flat with the prior year and 2015 was flat to 2014, but they were 40% exposed or so to the wireless infrastructure space which was weak for us and they really rallied through it partly because they were also a portion of our defense business that\xe2\x80\x99s really doing well and so they really had a great result in 2015 from the defense business. So we\xe2\x80\x99re very happy with it in terms of what it achieved for us just in terms of - just revenue that it provided.
And then we got all of the synergies we expected, so from accretion perspective it hit or it checked all the boxes. The real synergy that we really care about is the revenue synergy obviously and most of these products that Hittite did are kind of long cycle time between when you start to design and when you ultimately get revenue. I mean it is definitely years particularly in defense and instrumentation, which are areas that they are heavily focused on.
But the way we track it is just looking at the opportunity pipeline, watching the conversions into what we call design-ins which ultimately converted to design wins, which ultimately convert into revenue and its tracking way better than we expected. I would say the buzz we got from our customers and from our salespeople was tremendous on this thing, they were really excited about it and we started winning things in terms of opportunities like right out of the gate.
And then on top of that we\xe2\x80\x99ve rolled all those products into distribution, so distributors can put that as part of the line card and the distributors were really excited about having that. It was kind of a holding their offering that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t provide that so they\xe2\x80\x99ve done a great job I think on top of our design activity adding additional design activity that I think will ultimately translate into revenue.
So we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how all this plays out, it takes a long time before it kind of works its way through. But I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll get our synergies earlier and at a higher level than we originally anticipate.
Unidentified Analyst
I want to put you on spot a little bit as anybody trying to quantify them and because clearly when you initially made the bid for Hittite that\xe2\x80\x99s part of your valuation calculation you had to have some expectation of a longer-term growth rate for Hittite coming in better I am just kind of curious quantify that a little bit.
David Zinsner
Yes. We thought we could do as we could bend that curve by a few percent relative to what they were growing at. I\xe2\x80\x99d say were probably mid single-digit percentage maybe in high single-digits ultimately if you look at it over our larger and long enough period.
Unidentified Analyst
Successful with Hittite, talk about your M&A strategy from here I mean that was a sort of find really good IP, bring it into your company. Is there a need or desire for you guys to try to do M&A around scale and clearly given your footprint in converters would scale around power would be something that you would look at or help us understand the M&A strategy from here.
David Zinsner
Well, we ask customers all the time and I think for us what drives a decision around M&A is around, what do the customers want, what do they want us to do. I\xe2\x80\x99d say when you start talking to them about things that are more about broader catalogs and more scales. We get kind of a tepid response to that from customers. What they really care about for us is that we can provide technology that helps develop systems for them that\'s more than what we can do today.
Hittite was a furry example in a lot of areas, but let\xe2\x80\x99s takes instrumentation, instrumentation we were providing a lot of the signal processing, but they needed microwave, it was important component. So we could now provide that and they were begging us to do it this was a big deal for them.
So those are the areas that I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll focus on is power a part of that, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a significant part of that over time could it be it could be, but that remains to be seen. I think there are lots of other parts of the signal processing and even beyond that in terms of algorithms and software that would make or insecurity that would make our systems more robust that I think most of which we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to do organically some of which we won\'t be able to and those are the areas we\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on for acquisition.
We are not looking for broken companies that we got to roll up our sleeves and fix, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for companies that are already performing at a high level like Hittite was that we can kind of turbocharge and perform at an even higher level.
Unidentified Analyst
Are there any questions from the audience? Dave, I\xe2\x80\x99ll continue, industrial sort of a catch up phrase for a lot of semiconductor companies is tongue in cheek the definition of industrial is it goes in places we are quite sure where it\xe2\x80\x99s goes and I think you guys probably have 13 or 14 different sub buckets within industrial. One point autos versus sub bucket of industrial and they got large enough to actually be broken out. I guess help us understand within industrial what are the sub buckets you think that are most likely to be kind of the next big enough bucket to maybe be a standalone breakout your P&L?
David Zinsner
Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having industrial other which is the catch all of the catch all. So they\xe2\x80\x99re faced broad, really broad one that I think would be tough to define like factory automation and instrumentation that I think will always be to just kind of grouped into that industrial bucket, but healthcare is an area that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see an evolution towards clinical-grade and vital signs monitoring at the home, at the doctor\'s office, that I think could be a big market that the healthcare business for us has been growing at a pretty good clip and there is an opportunity to see that potentially to be broken out over time.
Ironically I think aerospace and defense might be one that we might want to breakout over time given how much it\xe2\x80\x99s grown. And then lastly I think you\xe2\x80\x99re missed if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention the one that everybody likes to talk about which is IoT. IoT for us is tough to define because it touches all those markets and some of the other markets that we serve, but there are probably in some ways to pivot there and talk about that business in a way that I think helps investors understand the magnitude of what we got. I mean that is several hundred million dollars of revenue right now and we are really just getting started into that space.
Unidentified Analyst
Dave, on the medical side how many years out or before we can get medical grade into things like what I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing on my risk today?
David Zinsner
Good question. I think the leading OEMs that are focused in that I would say have a plan that would get them there in the kind of 2018, 2019 timeframe. Now whether they get there and they get the adoption and they get all whatever approvals they need to get we will see how that goes, but at least from a targeting perspective that\'s where they are focused on.
What will be interesting I think is some of the ones that are actually - those are the big OEMs that already focused on healthcare, what will be interesting is some of these OEMs that are more consumer oriented and you\xe2\x80\x99ll ask one of the reasons why we have to participate in consumer, because very likely they could move up into the clinical-grade part of the market as opposed to some of these larger OEMs kind of moving into it or holding it.
So we are obviously in some of those devices and we are in some of the OEMs that want to be in, clinical-grade and vital signs monitoring and hopefully those companies are successful to and I don\xe2\x80\x99t make the business even bigger.
Unidentified Analyst
Great, with that we are running out of time in this session, but I want to thank Dave and everyone in the audience for participating this afternoon. Dave, thank you. That\xe2\x80\x99s great
David Zinsner
Thank you. Take care.
