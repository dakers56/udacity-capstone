Siti Panigrahi
All right let\'s get started, I\'m Siti Panigrahi, analyst here at software team at Credit Suisse. Today we have Scott Herren, CFO from Autodesk. Scott, welcome to the conference.
Scott Herren
Thank you very much.
Siti Panigrahi
Yes, so you just came from your Autodesk University User Conference. So why don\'t you kick off with what you are hearing, what are the key themes, what you\'re hearing from your customer, maybe just kick off with that.
Scott Herren
Sure, in fact our Autodesk University which is our annual end user event is actually still going on in Las Vegas. [indiscernible] be here because this is an important event. I\'ll fly back. In fact, as soon as we finish we will not -- I will not have time for a breakout. Got to zip back to the airport to get back to Las Vegas.
Siti Panigrahi
I Appreciate that.
Scott Herren
You know the event, it\'s every year as we get our customers together, it focuses on a couple of things. One is where we see the overall markets headed and the implications of that to their businesses. So if you think about whether it\'s a architecture, engineering or construction customer or a manufacturing customer, there\'s some pretty important trends in the industry right now that are going to have an effect on the way they get their jobs done in the future. And so one of the things they\'ve come to expect from us is thought leadership. And so in the keynotes we had for example Carl talking about where he -- the importance of the platform transition we\'re making.
I think a lot of times, and we may have inadvertently fanned this a little bit, people tend to think of the business model transition we\'re going through as a pricing model change. Still in the same stop, you\'re just changing the way you price you, you sell to same customers; and that\'s actually -- that significantly undervalues what we\'re doing. What we believe, and Carl was pretty explicit on this front is, there\'s something far bigger happening. This is a fundamental platform change, from engineering and design software running on workstations and PCs to all of that moving to the cloud. And that\'s the way we see the future going, and there\'s a whole set of reasons that are -- not technology reasons that we see that happening.
And so he talked about the platform transition, he talked about the importance of what that will enable. And in particular when you get to the cloud, you get a lot, you get elastic compute capacity. And when you think of the sophistication of some of the software and the tools that we design and sell, having elastic compute power is pretty important. So that\'s one advantage, the collaboration, the connection capabilities in the cloud.
There\'s another that I think lends itself very specifically to our market. So talked about that. And then in addition a couple of changes that are more -- methodically changes everything in enterprise software, not just Autodesk business. And then specifically generative design and its relationship to additive manufacturing or 3D printing, which will have an effect in the near term on manufacturing. It will also have an effect on architecture, engineering and construction as more and more buildings are assembled out of prefab parts as opposed to being stick built on site. So talked about that, really got into generative design and additive manufacturing.That was kind of the thought leadership side of the conference.
In tandem yesterday we had an investor track. So we had 30 to 35 investors in town. I had a customer panel first thing in the morning; three customers and the forum was after just a quick set of introductory comments, just Q&A: Investors to our customers, and they talked about the advantage of the subscription model and the questions were around are you concerned about the subscription model and what it\'s going to mean to you longer term. What do you think it implies for the vector of your spend with Autodesk? They talked about what are the things -- if you could ask for something from Autodesk, what would that be. So good kind of open forum for about two hours. And then we had lunch where all of the senior executive team got together and we had a little bit of a Q&A on that. So it\'s actually a really good start. It\'s about 10,000 people up in Las Vegas that go to that and it\'s been -- I think so far it\'s been very nicely received.
Siti Panigrahi
That\'s good color. I just want to go back to some of this long-term guidance. You talked it during your Investors Day a few months back. So you talked about 20% CAGR by 2020. So what are the elements or [indiscernible] you\'d consider when you talk about that?
Scott Herren
Right, it\'s a great question. We actually talked about two different CAGRs. We talked about the compound annual growth rate of our ARR, Annualized Recurring Revenue at 24% from the end of this fiscal year -- which is our fiscal \'16, out through the end of fiscal \'20, so over a four-year timeframe; and that being driven by largely by a 20% CAGR in subscription -- not subscribers, subscriptions. I use those terms interchangeably sometimes as well and they\'re not. So subscription growth. So the question is on the 20% subscription growth, what\'s going to fuel that, because that\xe2\x80\x99s what\'s going to fuel the ARR growth. And its four big pieces. It\'s we have a run rate of sales, a run rate of demand for licenses every year and we just talked about this on our last earnings call. That\'s been in a range of 500,000 to 800,000 new units sold every year. So the is the run rate -- after Q2 of next year, all of those sales will be subscription sales. So that\'s the only way we\'re going to sell a product after we get to the end the sale of perpetual license of suites, which will happen mid-year next year. That\'s one part.
There\'s the -- we have about 2.8 million active customers meaning they brought a license from us in the last five years, but don\'t have any maintenance attached to it. So active but non-subscribers. And of course we look to convert them as those licenses age and they need to run among Windows 10 or new peripherals or the net new functionality is great enough that they\'re ready to move, unless they buy a new perpetual license before the end of this year or if it\'s a suite, before the middle of next year, their only option will be to buy a subscription. So that\'s the second element that will drive the [indiscernible] 
Siti Panigrahi
[indiscernible] of that 
Scott Herren
We assumed about 30% -- what\'s built into the model is about 30% of those 2.8 million will convert in that four-year time frame. The third is what I called noncompliant customers. So these are users of the software that aren\'t fully paying for their license, and I think they come in a couple of flavors. I don\'t like the term piracy. They come in couple of flavors, people who are intentionally depriving you, intentionally trying to steal from you, and while that\'s not our focus, we will have better tracking mechanisms to understand that and go after it, but I think the larger component of non-compliant customers are those -- they really do want to be complaint -- that are inadvertently noncompliant, that have potentially project based work and they need access to more licenses but just for a 6 to 12 month timeframe, and buying a perpetual license is very expensive when the access is for 6 to 12 months. We\'ll be able to sweep those people in.So I think the third element is, and it\'s a smaller piece, but it\'s an important piece because we have a lot of -- large covert of non-compliant users today.
And then finally it\'s just time expansion. As we move to the cloud, and I don\'t just mean the cloud as a computational platform. I mean mobile access to that computational platform as well. And as we move there the opportunity to significantly expand the user base within construction and within manufacturing is significant. So those are the four elements that we see driving that 20% CAGR over the next four years.
Siti Panigrahi
That\'s a good target but then in your vision, Q3 you found out net subscribers adds, like 80k was mixed expectation and then you guided down. So what are the factors -- it that something like maintenance attach rate, weakness on that, or it\'s something there\'s a new subscription. What\'s going on, and how should we think about that metric going forward?
Scott Herren
Yes, great question, and we talked about little bit on the earnings call, callbacks. But I think it\'s one that bears repeating. So two elements drive. So the 80,000 is net subscriber adds. Soit\'s net of churn. So two big pieces that drove that 80,000, what I\'m calling new model. A new model is the new subscription type. So it\'s our term license, which we call best of subscription to cloud products and it\'s our large EDAs, our enterprise products. And that piece, and we now give you the granularity, how much of the 80,000 was driven by that, it was about 47,000. So that piece grew nicely and grew nicely. Actually it\'s grown nicely all the year.
The other piece of the 80,000 is maintenance, net maintenance adds and there\'s two chunks to net maintenance adds. One is renewals. And so like people that had brought licenses in prior years, attached maintenance to it, those maintenance came due for renewal. We have a very high renewal rate and the renewal rate has stayed steady throughout this time. If anything, slightly biased to the upside over the last several quarters. That piece was as expected. The one thing I will say is since the 80,000 is net adds, we have a high renewal rate but it\'s not a 100% and it\'s not a 100% times a big number. It\'s a big installed base of maintenance. So that actually provides a headwind to the net subscriber adds for the quarter and will continue to be a headwind all through time.
The second piece of the maintenance adds, our new maintenance agreements that are sold attach to new perpetual licenses. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way for a new maintenance agreement to come in. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the piece that was below what we had expected for Q3. It was below what we had expected. The new perpetual license sales were below our expectations in Q2 as well. And so given where -- the number of net subscriber add, subscription adds, we were coming out of Q3 with was 263,000, we knew we needed to change the full year guidance rather than expect to get to the midpoint of 160,000, 170,000 net subscription adds in Q4. That\xe2\x80\x99s what led to the guide down and it\xe2\x80\x99s really of the three elements; new models assigned, renewals of existing maintenance assigned, the attach rate by the way of maintenance agreements to new perpetual license is also fine, and has actually also been slightly biased to the upside, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just been attached to a much smaller number than our expectations were at the beginning of the year when we laid out that 375 to 425. So that\xe2\x80\x99s what underpinned the guide down.
Siti Panigrahi
So another thing is that we have cost reduction initiative that you talked about recently. What prompted that change and what are the areas you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do the cost control?
Scott Herren
It\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of work to get to that. So in the quarter that we just announced, which ended on October 31st, the total spending increase year-on-year was 1%. And so that\xe2\x80\x99s the sum of COGS plus OpEx. I think a lot of people just look at OpEx and it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand it\xe2\x80\x99s both, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen our gross margins actually come under a little bit of pressure. We\'ve probably had 200 basis points of erosion in gross margin. As we\xe2\x80\x99ve invested in the infrastructure to run our cloud products, that infrastructure falls into COGS, not into OpEx. So even with that headwind, we still only grew total spend by 1% in Q3.
And if you look at the guidance we gave for Q4, it implies then gross in that same 1% to 2% range. And so what drove that is consistent conversations over the past. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the role four quarters. So over the past four quarters and perhaps longer where we heard a couple of things really consistently. One is, as you guys make this transition and move to a subscription and a recurring revenue model, we think you\xe2\x80\x99re creating great value. Products are sticky, they\xe2\x80\x99re industry leading products. You can make this shift and you get a lot greater visibility, a lot less volatility. We\xe2\x80\x99re bought in. We like the vision. And we laid out, we\'ve actually quantified what that vision will look like for fiscal \xe2\x80\x9920 in our recent Investor Day.
But the second thing we heard was -- so we liked that piece. The second thing we heard was what we expect as you make this shift, that there will be a tick down, there will be an inflection point down in top line as you go shipping from perpetual licenses to subscription. And we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see you be far more prudent with your spend through that shift, which makes sense of course. What\xe2\x80\x99s really hard about that is this is a platform transition. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a pricing change. And so with that there\'s a lot of investment required on the R&D side. There is a lot of investment required to change, to add elements to our route to market, our go to market engine, adding more inside sales for example to drive renewals.
There\'s work to do in marketing, there\'s work to do in my finance team. The number of transactions we\xe2\x80\x99re going to process are significantly higher. So there is a lot of investment to be taken, but listening to the feedback we said all right, so we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to slow that down, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to slow down the transition. We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to for the sake of saving a few pennies today blunt the future that we see happening, and driving this transition to happen as quickly as possible. But we focused a lot more on what I\'d call the usual suspects, T&E [ph] on contractors, on spending, and then really looked at getting more focused, looked at all the projects we had going around the Company and just driving greater focus and reallocating resources that we had on some of those projects over to the more strategic areas.
So that\xe2\x80\x99s what drove it. It took a fair amount of work to get there. You can\xe2\x80\x99t just turn the spending engine down. We spend north of -- between COGS and OpEx, north of $2 billion a year. You can\xe2\x80\x99t just slow that engine down overnight. It takes quite a bit of work. We expect it to stay in this 1% to 2% growth range, not just for Q4 which is what our guidance is, but on the spend fees, we expect it to stay in that range through fiscal \xe2\x80\x9917 as well.
Siti Panigrahi
Another point is that all of this is pretty channel heavy.If you look at your channel business, it\'s pretty high at this point. So could you talk about the channel economics and how should we think about that\xe2\x80\x99s going to change or evolve as you seen, as you transition to the cloud market? I mean we have seen that for Adobe. So how should we expect to model that?
Scott Herren
The channel will continue to be an important part of our mix, of our sales mix. And it\xe2\x80\x99s because the software we sell is fairly sophisticated software. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t something I can just download from the Web and go. It\xe2\x80\x99s not Office 365, just to use as an example. There is a role to be played for the channel longer term. I think that where the channel needs to evolve though is recognize that the longer term -- the sensible position for them in terms of driving their own profit is from driving real value add activities with their customers as opposed to -- and I think a lot of our partners are doing that by the way, are driving the real value add activities. But for the minority that are focused on just trying to make money based on product mark up, buy it from Autodesk at $100 and I sell it for $110, that business is going to be a tough business going forward.
So longer term I do expect the channel to continue to grow in absolute terms, the sales that come through the channel. But I think the way the channel makes money will change to them making a lot more of their profits driven byvalue added services and that\'s sticky. That\'s sticky between them and their customers, who ultimately are our customers. Of the overall mix though, I think more of it -- we\'ll see more of the overall mix shift and Steve showed this at Analyst Day. More of that mix will shift to more direct touch type sales. So absolute terms, the channel will grow. They\'ll continue to be the majority of our sales. But the mix of direct versus indirect by the time we get to fiscal \'20 will be significantly different than it is right now.
Siti Panigrahi
Same thing that channel economics will change too.
Scott Herren
Yes, their economics will be what I said. They\'re going to need to drive their profits. It won\'t necessarily drive the majority of their topline of their gross revenues, but the majority of their profits will be driven by it, and in many cases are today driven by real value added services around the product.
Siti Panigrahi
So, you switch from let\'s say now transition to cloud, then you\'ll have maintenance customer base and then you have the subscription base. It\'s more like you\'re offering two different -- same values with two different pricing. How should we think about that? As you -- this is one discussion we keep having with investors that are -- what are you going to do in terms of maintenance price hike? As you transition and as you start offering similar kind of value to your customers at different prices?
Scott Herren
With all deference to Phil, and I wish he was here. What we\'re not going to do is raise them 20% a year for five straight years. I like the analysis that that\'s probably not appropriate for our customers. What you\'ll see us do, and we\'ve talked a little bit about this is encourage -- a maintenance customer is a good customer by the way. They bought a perpetual license and they bought maintenance and they continue to renew maintenance. There\'s nothing wrong with that. That\'s ARR. That\'s a recurring customer. We have an ongoing dialogue with that customer. They\'re using the latest and greatest versions of our product. There\'s more value to us and to them converting them off of maintenance and onto a term license and ultimately onto a cloud subscription. So the way we\'ll look to encourage that out through time is by adding more value into the desktop version.
So what does that mean? Let\'s say I\'m an Inventor customer who bought a perpetual license, bought maintenance and I continue to renew maintenance. So I continue to get the latest release of Inventor every year when it comes out. Compare them to an Inventor customer on desktop subscription. The executables of Inventor itself will be the same in each case. We\'re not going to differentiate this version of Inventor has more functionality than this version. That\'ll be the same. What you\'ll see us do is add value to the desktop for the term license version of Inventor with other things that make sense in an online world. So things like ARA360 offering, bundling in some A360 capability. What A360 allows is cloud based file sharing, and real based access to those cloud files. You\'ll see us do things like bundle in cloud credits. So if I\'m designing a car for example and using Inventor to design the car, I can get to a point where I\'ll say hey, you know what I\'d love to do a little CFD, a little Computational Fluid Dynamic sense of what is the -- what are the forces that are being created by the shape of the front end of my car. We\'ll bundle in cloud credit and allow them to just go up to the cloud and take the model that they\'ve been working on Inventor and do that testing. So how we\'ll encourage that movement away from maintenance, we\'re not going to penalize our maintenance customers. We\'re not going to do punitive price increases. We will have price increases by the way all through time more consistently than we have in the past, but they\'ll be more cost of living style increases, but we\'ll encourage them with higher value to move over to the term license and to our cloud.
Siti Panigrahi
What we\'re seeing is the same value offering with increased price like forced into transitions of those systems but other you were saying that you\'ll offer lower value for the other subscription and a higher value so they\'ll be incentivized to migrate. There\'s no other way, either offer -- jack up the price and offer the same value or lower the value by that.
Scott Herren
So we\'re not going to lower the value for the maintenance customer, but we\'re going to increase the value for the\xe2\x80\xa6.
Siti Panigrahi
That\'s a relative, yes okay. Let me pause here and see if there are any questions from audience. Kind of raise your hand. Okay I guess I\'ll continue then. So another thing is when you transition from desktop to subscription based model what sort of like, looking at the competitive landscape, do you feel any kind of threat there, like your customer churn to your competitors, any update. Or maybe you should talk about the competitive landscape at this point, how sticky you know.
Scott Herren
Sure, I would say -- we have two major markets right architecture, engineering and construction, and manufacturing. We have a very strong position in the architecture, engineering and construction side. And I think making the transition over to some of the cloud based products actually is an easier step for them to take. They get it, because they\'re you know if you think of construction you\'re outbound, you\'re field based. And so being able to get to the capabilities of our products with a mobile device in your hand just makes perfect sense. So I don\'t feel making the shift is as big a step on that front and I think that we\'re in a stronger competitive position in that front. On the manufacturing side we\'re top three. You know you can debate whether we\'re number two or number three on the manufacturing side. But where we\'re headed -- first the term license is just the first step. Where we\'re headed is into the cloud. And what I mean by that is the executables and the data actually reside in the cloud as opposed to our term license, gives you the same product functionality. It\'s still downloaded and executed locally. So you still need a full-fledged machine to run it. The cloud is where you start to un-tether and it\xe2\x80\x99s where you really start to say, look whatever device you\xe2\x80\x99ve got in your hand, you can drive this. I think there will be competitive response to where we\xe2\x80\x99re -- that\'s our Fusion 360 product, the manufacturing. We spent a lot of time building out the capabilities and building out the functionality of Fusion 360 and feel like we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pretty good lead in that front.
Significantly higher lead relative to our traditional competitors in the manufacturing space, which relative to the Windows based technology there, ours or SolidWorks or Siemens, or PTC, share shift happens really, really slowly in that space. That battle has been fought to a bit of draw I would say. The real opportunity for us in manufacturing to change the game is a platform shift, and as the platform shifts out of the executables being in a highpowered PC onto those being up in the cloud, the toolset changes, the simple use for tab and then for the cam piece, of actually fabricating those parts. And as that happens, that\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for disruption, an opportunity for significant change in share. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you see us putting so much focus on Fusion 360, and really driving that cloud based product on the manufacturing side very heavily.
So I think -- will there be competitive response? There will. Will there be non-traditional competitors in that space? Absolutely. We see a few already. I think that helps make the case for why we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it. And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s probably less of a concern about the term license space between here and there.
Siti Panigrahi
So last question, probably on the macro, I think you were pleased although that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty sensitive to macro environment your buying behavior changes. How is that -- first of all talk about bad macro and how is that going to change in the context of now you\xe2\x80\x99re switching from perpetual to subscription based?
Scott Herren
So if I just look at the macro environment today and look at what\xe2\x80\x99s built into the projections that we laid out at Investor Day, we\xe2\x80\x99re not expecting any big change. We\xe2\x80\x99re not expecting the world to get a lot better, but we\xe2\x80\x99re also not expecting it to get a lot worse. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a change in the macro environment through the year this year. Places that have been tough have continued to be tough. Brazil and Russia have been really tough. The overall economies in both countries are struggling. China continues actually to be pretty good for us. Japan economically is struggling. Japan has been a little bit tough for us.
So that\xe2\x80\x99s how it\xe2\x80\x99s been so far. We\xe2\x80\x99re not -- we haven\xe2\x80\x99t factored in any big change into the model. I think the more interesting point is I think the second part of your question, which is so what does this imply long term. When you transition from largely perpetual license sales to almost entirely subscription sales, which by the second half of next year that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll sell. If there is a next downturn, how resilient is the revenue stream, and the big difference in a pure subscription model is if you get to a point where you are cash flow crunched, you can always say I know my licenses are old but the product still works and I can still run it. So I won\xe2\x80\x99t buy any new perpetual licenses this year.
In the future when all those are term based licenses or cloud based models, if you stop paying for it, the product stops working. So would we be affected by significant macro downturn? Of course we would. Everyone will be affected by a big macro downturn. Will it be as extreme as it\xe2\x80\x99s been in the past when we sold perpetual licenses? It will dampen the effect being on a subscription model.
Siti Panigrahi
Scott, with that we\xe2\x80\x99re out of time. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you.
