Q - Unidentified Analyst
Good morning everybody. Welcome to Day 2 of Barclays TMT Conference. Very happy to have with us today Carl Bass, CEO of Autodesk, as well as Dave Gennarelli, Head of Investor Relations and Scott Herren, CFO and some around here. We are going to - we have got about 30 minutes for the session whereas for the first 20 minutes or so - 15 or 20 minutes with just a little bit of fireside chat with me and I will make sure I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave enough time for any questions from the audience. So with that first and foremost, thanks for making time Carl.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s just start very high level, Carl. In terms of the general demand environment, and I want to talk about the geographies, but I also want to talk about some of the different verticals in terms of manufacturing an ADC [ph]. What are your customers in each of those verticals sort of saying to you about what\xe2\x80\x99s going to make them drive - buy more software in 2016?
Carl Bass
So if I start with manufacturing, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much in keeping the historical trends and if you look at the economic data, you would get a pretty good feel of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on around the world. They are starting to look at new technology, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a burning platform at this point. People understand manufacturing is going to move to the cloud, they still need some experiment, they are interested in something. Generally speaking, manufacturers have two concerns. They want something that I think that this - they broadly call innovation. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a competitive advantage and if you want to be a little bit more [indiscernible] about it, they want the Apple premium. They want somehow to have a product, this phone is 100 and there is a $300 phone, everybody wants to somehow copy what Apple has managed to do. And second thing they want to do is to get products to market faster. So generally speaking, there are on a run rate as before and they are looking to figure out how do I come up with more competitive products or how do I get them to market faster, bunch of cloud based helps them do that. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think at this point in time, it\xe2\x80\x99s really I guess a burning platform, it\xe2\x80\x99s early stages. The architecture engineering construction market completely different. Construction is a gigantic industry, generally low margins and try to drive efficiencies in there and they recognize that it is all coming through technology. And so the investments in technology and construction over the last 10 years have skyrocketed and I think they continue to recognize and there is a burning platform. They need to get on the new technology, they need to distribute information to the workforce out on the construction side, so there is a lot going on in ADC.
Unidentified Analyst
Absolutely. Maybe we can just look at from a different view point geographically. Realizing that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a crystal ball, as you look at 2016, obviously a very global business, just talk to us about what you\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from the different geographies, EMEA, APAC and the Americas, obviously from an economic pertaining to each of them. But how do you sort of see that the demand environments in each of those kind of head into next year.
Carl Bass
You know, 75% of our business is outside the US. It pretty closely mirrors GDP of the world. So you can understand where our business is. What I see is, probably no different than what most of the people are saying is the US is strong, but not gangbusters. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been at the helping side of it, if there is such a thing. Europe is relatively okay. Places like Japan were weak. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t see it changing quickly, and I\xe2\x80\x99d say the emerging economies are very volatile. And so if I sat here last year or a year before, I will tell you one country is doing well and come back a year later. So two years ago, I would have told you Russia is going gangbusters, it\xe2\x80\x99s awesome. We pulled out most of our sales points in Russia because there is no business to be had in Russia today. Turkey would be the same way. A year ago, Turkey still would have been on the upswing and now it certainly is not.
Unidentified Analyst
I am going to shift a little bit to subscription transition, obviously a very tough conversation as well as some changes there with perpetual license being discontinued in calendar \xe2\x80\x9816. Just a level set for everybody here, just what way a new customer has options to enter the franchise and start using the tools. I think what we kind of call from the outside, a new model subscription, just go one level deeper for us in terms of how our customer can enter the franchise once perpetual is no longer offered.
Carl Bass
That one is the easiest question to answer. There is only one way to get there, essentially again it\xe2\x80\x99s desktop, so we are calling desktop subscription. You come into the franchise by buying a new term to license and you use it for - you buy a certain term a quarter, a year, multiple years and you use it for as long as you want, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how the whole business is moving in that general direction. There is more sort of details about other things you can buy along the way, but essentially the business goes from a business that sells perpetual licenses with maintenance to one that\xe2\x80\x99s all subscription.
Unidentified Analyst
I just want to talk about that decision to discontinuing perpetual, and obviously very well received by investor community, but from - as you sort of think about it competitively, why was discontinuing perpetual the right thing to do and did that change sort of the competitive dynamic at all with a player like a Solidworks for example or just talk to us about the strategy behind discontinuing perpetual and then competitively any impacts.
Carl Bass
Yeah, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s like most business decisions. If most business decisions were 100% on one side and zero on the other, we want actually people to do the jobs. The more interesting thing is here, there is definitely some risk in doing it, but we certainly felt that the benefits far outweighed the risks here. We thought the simplification of the business, both for Autodesk as well as for partners, quality to our customers. We think the subscription business model is actually really good for customers. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lower priced entry point for them. They pay according to what they need. So it\xe2\x80\x99s mostly more a changing habit, than it is anything else. Now, when we first announced this none of our other competitors were doing it and slowly they all started to do the same thing. And this is just once, we decided to lead the charge and I think three to five years from now, it will be very hard to find in any software company that is not termed license.
Unidentified Analyst
Actually just I want to take advantage of their experiences kind of in design for so many years. Why it was designed so softly, why it was designed really one of the latter areas in software to start to adopt subscription or cloud-based models.
Carl Bass
So, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a little easier to see why, design and engineering is in parts, we are looking to adopt some of the cloud technology and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s this slightly irrational fear within companies. So people say, they are worried about IP and security and everything else. Even though there is no indication that the other systems are more secure than cloud-based ones, but it\xe2\x80\x99s engineers making the argument. So they\'re filled with more technical facts about this. I don\'t think it makes any sense. If you look at any company that is now running, they have all their customer data, they have all their employee data, in many cases, they have enterprise financial data online, all of their email and other communication travels over the public Internet. This idea that these designs, these engineering joints can\'t be there doesn\'t make much sense to me.
And, but it often happens and I think this is more just a sociological phenomenon, when you want people to change, they have to see the benefits. And so I think there are substantial benefits to the business model change and the platform technology change, but that\'s what has to sell them. You don\'t just give then somebody to do it, because everyone else is doing it, and particularly, engineers who are more rational in some way, they need a real reason, why do I stop doing what I\'m doing today and adapt a new way of doing it.
Unidentified Analyst
Right. Let\xe2\x80\x99s touch a little bit on some of the longer-term kind of financial targets related to the transition, specifically, I think that 24% kind of annual recurring revenue kind of target through fiscal 20, the lion\'s share of that is going to be driven by subscriptions, I should say, and you gave a really useful metric on the last call about somewhere between 500,000 and 800,000 sort of, what I kind of call boxes, right, in a given year, right, just units of software and I kind of thought about that as a nice baseline to think about as we kind of drive that 20% subscription growth. First of all, is that the right way to think about that is that baseline and then the follow-up to that is if you do, do that, you clearly need more than the 500,000 to 800,000 sort of baseline to get to the target. So, there are clearly some other drivers in there, talk to us a little bit about some of those incremental drivers behind the baseline?
Carl Bass
Yeah. So, I think that\'s the right way to think about it and one of the things that we\'re trying to do in the next four quarters, there is uncertainty about whether people buy old model or a new model, while they still have a choice, different factors are going to drive them to different buying decisions, but what we try to do is give - kind of those total hamburgers sold and we gave you that number as an overall indication of demand.
To combine with one of your first questions is beginning in Q3 of next year, that is the only way customers can buy. So the 600,000 people who show up will be buying a subscription. They will choose which kind, but there are no other options at that point. The way to think about the math and I know there\'s been some confusion out there is about 600,000, 500,000 to 800,000 people show up to buy this historically. We\'ve also talked about the 2.9 million people who are customers, but are not on maintenance.
And we\'ve said that over the course of the transition, we felt we can move 30% and there are certainly people who have accused the sandbagging that number and so why couldn\'t you drive that number a lot higher and I can at least tell you the math behind it is that just before last year, when we used to have upgrades, an upgrade is essentially that base of 2.9, moving to a new license. So it\'s the best indication, it\'s the most close resemblance to what people are talking about. So we averaged somewhere around the 100,000 people per year.
So if you look at that, that was about 3% of that base, call it 3% to 5% per year we move over. And so if you take 75,000 to 100,000 people move over, that\'s one part of it. The other part of the equation is you\xe2\x80\x99re left with 500,000 people who buy something. Where do those people come from? Some certainly come out of that base, some come from heavy used competitive products in other places, but I think it gives you the most complete, but not full picture of understanding the dynamics.
When you ask the question now, is how do you get beyond that is you look at the subscribers and okay, there is the people who are there, who are going to be that 600,000, some of them move over, there is going to be a share shift, there is going to be market expansion and there is this big untapped pool of people who have pirated the software historically. And so when you put all that together, those are the kind of factors that went into the model that we\'ve shown.
Unidentified Analyst
Sure. So I want to talk about that 2.9 million, because that 75,000 to 100,000 kind of idea sounded interesting. Just to clarify, so is it, are you sort of looking back to sort of the traditional volume of upgrade activity that you had in a given year and that\'s what kind of contributed to that 30%. Okay.
Carl Bass
Yeah. So, that\'s how we came up with the 30%. There is imperfect tracking there. You just can just certainly who are in that 2.9 base historically, they could have gone and bought the new license. So they could come into the 600,000, but not be part of that 75,000. Very difficult for us to track that. There may be the different company, they may sign up under a different name, we cannot track that, but when we were just starting out with the basic thing, let\'s say, you can get 3% to 5% a year, we felt over a period of time, getting to 30% was reasonable. You can make other arguments why that could be higher, but it was not an unreasonable conservative assumption to go with, particularly when we think the model is really compelling on the other side, just on the other factors.
Unidentified Analyst
Sure. Now, we\'ve got a D-Day here for one perpetual kind of is fully gone, how do you sort of and promotions have always been a big lever that Autodesk has had in any given timeframe. How are you sort of approaching promotional activity pricing on perpetual/maintenance as we get to that D-Day if you will?
Carl Bass
I would say our promotional activity is fairly neutral. We\'re pretty agnostic. The customer wants to get on the new model. We\'re happy. Over a period of time, that\'s a more valuable customer for us, but if a customer in this last three quarters really likes the perpetual model and wants to stock up on them, we\'re not going to discourage them. Some people have really looked at our maintenance customers in some kind of pejorative way and I\xe2\x80\x99m like, these are our best customers.
These are people who historically bought perpetual licenses and then they got on maintenance. This is our best customer, so if somebody wants to continue being our best customer, the way they did before, great. I think there is an obligation on our part to attract them to some of the new offerings and I think we can compel them to do it, but in this time period, I think we\'re relatively in partial to which model they choose.
Unidentified Analyst
Got it. I just want to touch on some of the pricing differential there, kind of that term affectionately known as ARPS, but we\'ve got about 14 to 15 minutes left, I\'m going to make sure I open up the mic to any questions you might have in the audience. And maybe just on that topic of ARPS, frankly to me that feels like the hardest part to kind of predict, I think it\'s really about the mix of products, right, as perpetual goes away. Just broad brush, not necessarily specific numbers, but how should we sort of think about how low that ARPS number can go?
Carl Bass
The ARPS, so you are talking about the 3%.
Unidentified Analyst
I am talking about the 3%, exactly.
Carl Bass
And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said is don\xe2\x80\x99t look at it. We tell you what it is, but don\xe2\x80\x99t look at it. And let me give you kind of the algebraic analysis and then I will give you the kind of color commentary. What we\xe2\x80\x99ve said about the 3% and why not to pay attention and instead to look at the 20% growth and the 24% growth is because the 3% is all around mix. And if you look at it, there are a bunch of products that we are introducing to capture new parts of the market. So, for example, in construction we have historically sold things with prices of about $1,000 per year, because they have been individual products for architects and engineers.
The biggest place for growing in the ANCE market is in construction. Now, we think the size of that market in total revenue is much bigger than A&E and we think the number of years is there. It is way higher. In order of two orders of magnitude larger, but they are going to pay less. So for example, a construction work around the construction site wants access to the most up to date plans. They are probably willing let\xe2\x80\x99s call it $150 or $200 per year per user. Getting that dollars and people in the construction company at $150 per year is a great sale for us. And it cements our product into the entire workflow.
If you put that $150 per year against our user base, it is going to drive down ARPS tremendously. So you ask the question and I will be a little bit snarky and say, we could exceed every metric we care about and drive ARPS negative, that would still be okay. And so ARPS is much more a derivative number, the thing that matters, because it is all about mix. And the thing that matters is the number of subscriptions and that\xe2\x80\x99s the place to be concerned and then look at the ARR. I mean, there are other things out there that will give very clear indications back to the total hamburger sold, all those things matter, I mean not a lot, but the 3%, we just want to give people an indication of how do you get to these numbers, in our mind, is because we add so many subscriptions at lower price per year.
Unidentified Analyst
I want to shift a little bit to the cost of the equation, so let\xe2\x80\x99s again open up to the audience to any questions. One here upfront. You have to just wait for the mike for them at the webcast.
Question about competition. Could you give us a bit of color on how the competitive landscape is looking and is there particularly any big threats that you are concerned about from startups and things like that?
Carl Bass
No, I\xe2\x80\x99d say the threat - the competitive landscape is pretty consistent in terms of the large players. The one color commentary I have about the large players is they seem to be dragging their feet about moving to the cloud, so not a lot of the innovation out of the other large players in the market. The place where I see the most startups and the most interesting ones are startups in kind of the construction side. People are going after this multi-trillion dollar market and coming at it from all kinds of different angle, so it\xe2\x80\x99s -
And with the awareness amongst the construction companies that they need to spend on technology to drive greater efficiencies, that\xe2\x80\x99s where there is lots of investment. So, lots of interesting startups on the construction side. On the manufacturing side, now I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything interesting out there, but - and the other dynamic is really just the established companies being relatively conservative in moving to the technology platform.
Unidentified Analyst
Just to kind of think of - talk about the cost side of the equation a little bit, in this past quarter I think we were talking about maybe 1% total expense growth year-over-year, one of the slower rates of growth that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Autodesk in a while. Where were you able to find that increased efficiency? It seems like we are expecting that same level of efficiency going to the next quarter with kind of a similar growth rate attached? And how do you think about some of those efficiencies that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to - that you started to kind of ring out in context of that mid-single-digit growth rate that we talked about for in expenses through 2020?
Carl Bass
Yeah. I mean, so what I would say is, we came in at about 1%, and we said same thing about Q4, we said through FY17, 1% to 2% growth. Part of where we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about efficiencies for a number of years is that for right now we\xe2\x80\x99ve been running kind of double models, so we have two kinds of development, a desktop model and a cloud model. We have sales and marketing that\xe2\x80\x99s both kind of new model and old model and add some of the old models you start deprecating them and as they diminish in terms of the investment they need, those then start becoming lower cost.
So there is always the straight off between really two things. How much you want to invest in the future and how much risk you want to put on it. We think the business model is really compelling when you look out to the future. If you look out three years and you are through the transition, people have moved to the cloud, don\xe2\x80\x99t want to jeopardize, we want to invest, but on the other hand, one of the things we certainly heard from our large long term shareholders is during this period in which the transition goes on, can\xe2\x80\x99t you be more careful on cost. So starting early in the year we started saying, yeah, we got places on the margin that we could be more conservative.
And then there are some trends in the business that drive cost out of the system that it\xe2\x80\x99s just natural and so we certainly did some of that. And then we just did the usual kind of [indiscernible] really important and much critical and where can you take on a little more risk without diminishing the reward. And so we did the usual work in running the business. And so what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said for now is, you will see it these two quarters; you will see it for four quarters next year. I would imagine it continues beyond, but we will talk about that as we make our way through the transition.
Unidentified Analyst
Sure. When we think about cost, some investors that I speak is really focusing on that sales and marketing line, for good reason, just given the size. One of the things that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we really dug into a little bit is just as perpetual goes way, the impact on the cost of sales line, I mean these are boxes that we were shipping before, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s shipping cost, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s hardware cost that\xe2\x80\x99s involved with it. Once that perpetual goes away fully in August of next year, I believe, how should we think about maybe the - how quickly some of that cost of sale might go away and qualitatively maybe how does to size it, does it make sense.
Carl Bass
I mean some of it also depend on the mix, but we - I mean we have over the last five years, been moving to lower cost distribution. So just broadly speaking, people talk about our channel, we have multiple channels and we have been moving to lower cost channels. I think the dynamics of the channel continue to evolve. For our middle tier customers, our channel partners doing valuable job in servicing them and I think that will continue. The two places where we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the broadest change is on small customers who are using high volume, low cost channels for us, which might be in our store or Amazon, or CDW. Traffic there has picked up, it is a good business for those companies, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for it to go direct with us and it\'s not a really profitable business for our partners.
And the other place where our business is growing substantially is at the high end where we\'re going direct. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a little bit about flexible licensing in the enterprise and that\'s been a hugely successful initiative for us. We continuing, I\'d say we\'re doubling down on that, loved every part of that, it is customers use more, they pay more, and they are happier. So this is just a win, win, win and so we\'re going to continue to do more flexible licensing offerings across the board.
Unidentified Analyst
If we could take it to sales and marketing for a second, because you talked about interesting dynamic there in terms of you know we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do more direct right, so the enterprise kind of software sales person versus a little bit less in channel on a percentage basis, not a gross dollar basis. Help us a little bit about that shift in expenses in sales and marketing as you go more direct, can you ship some of those expenses better kind of related to the channel towards that, so maybe a little bit more of a neutral impact on sales and marketing spend -
Carl Bass
I think you see the spend on sales and marketing go down actually. As you make your way through the transition sales and marketing spend definitely goes down on a percentage basis.
Unidentified Analyst
As a percentage, right got it, got it. In the last few minutes that we\'ve got left, and you talked a little bit earlier about just talking to a shareholder just on margins and kind of through the transition, we\'ve seen sort of a more active shareholder on the owners list recently. Just to kind of keep it very open ended, how has the conversation at the board level for you changed strategically since [indiscernible] gotten involved if at all?
Carl Bass
I mean, I think I answered this on the phone call. I learned about those guys getting involved, just as you did, I read it in a - placed in an article in the press and you know did their filing. And I reached out, because one of the things they said in it was they would like to talk to management and having never met them I called them and said here is management, what would you like to say, and they said, well, we like to see in person. So we scheduled a meeting, so there is really no news to report. Look forward to hearing from them, and we have many people choose not to taking active as well which is a just attractive.
We have a broad range of investment philosophies, but one thing I would say about our investors is that they\'re not shy about expressing their opinion about what we should do or what we could do better and so we\xe2\x80\x99re open to listening to them. I\'m sure this room has its ideas about what we should do and in some ways; I don\'t think they deserve a special place. I think all of our shareholders, and particularly our long-term shareholders I\'m interested in hearing what they say. But I\xe2\x80\x99d also like hearing from anyone, I\'m kind of nondiscriminatory. If someone has a better idea about how to run a business, I really don\'t care where it comes from.
Unidentified Analyst
Sure, sure, maybe last question on that point just obviously, capital allocation a board level discussion, maybe some thoughts on what is - as you sort of think about the transition, how do you think about sort of the main uses of cash, sort of model changes that has impact on your cash balance.
Carl Bass
I think Scott and the team did a great job at our Investor Day kind of ringing it out. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\'ll see a big change in capital allocation through the next year. Next year is a trough in terms of many financial metrics included things like free cash flow from operations and I think it\'s a particularly vulnerable time. So as we start the conversation at a time at the lowest cash flow that we\xe2\x80\x99ve in years, I mean transitioning to the next year, where free cash flow starts increasing and grow substantially. Next year is probably not the right year, particularly with any sensitive - our sensitivity to macroeconomic stuff. So the worst thing that could happen is we get kind of out-of-the-box on capital allocation, we have an event like 2008 or 2009 that is actually bad. So I think next year is the year of caution and we along with the Board will review the options through this year as we make it through the transition and free cash flow will actually come back and exceed levels we are at over the historical periods.
Unidentified Analyst
Makes sense. Well, unfortunately, that\'s about all the time that we have with Carl. With that Carl, thanks for your attendance and your time.
Carl Bass
Thanks, okay it\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure.
